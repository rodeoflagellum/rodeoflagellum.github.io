__Overview__ 

> Biosecurity Tournament, Prize Pool: $25,000, End Date: Dec 30, 2024
> 
> This first-of-its kind, multi-year biosecurity forecasting tournament was developed in partnership with pandemic preparedness non-profit Guarding Against Pandemics and the research and advocacy think tank the Institute for Progress. The Biosecurity Tournament has three aims: to map out the future biosecurity risk landscape, to help direct resource allocation to the highest-impact interventions, and to inform the distribution of attention and efforts — all with a focus on global catastrophic biological risks (GCBRs).
> 
> The Metaculus Community’s forecasts will be shared with public health experts, informing their decision making and helping to mitigate future COVID-like risks. Guarding Against Pandemics has generously provided a $25,000 prize pool to support forecasting efforts.
> 
> Round 1 of this tournament is open for forecasting, with new questions arriving on 2022-6-16, 2022-6-23, 2022-6-30. We appreciate the forecasting community’s insights and expertise in furthering this critical initiative.

### Pandemic Prevention and Preparedness 

Find the question here: <https://www.metaculus.com/questions/11274/international-pandemic-treaty-before-2025/>

> The idea of an international treaty on pandemic prevention and preparedness has been recently discussed. According to a March 2021 joint article by leaders of 23 countries as well as President of the European Council and Director-General of the World Health Organisation, the main goal of such a treaty would be to:
> 
> > foster an all of government and all of society approach, strengthening national, regional and global capacities and resilience to future pandemics. This includes greatly enhancing international co-operation to improve, for example, alert systems, data-sharing, research and local, regional and global production and distribution of medical and public health counter-measures such as vaccines, medicines, diagnostics and personal protective equipment.
> 
> According to the European Council, the following are the anticipated next steps of the planned treaty:
> 
> > The intergovernmental negotiating body, tasked with drafting and negotiating this international instrument, will hold its next meeting by 1 August 2022, to discuss progress on a working draft. It will then deliver a progress report to the 76th World Health Assembly in 2023, with the aim to adopt the instrument by 2024.
> 
> The purpose of this question is to understand the potential of this treaty to be adopted.
> 
> Will at least 10 countries ratify a new international treaty on pandemic prevention and preparedness before 2025?
> 
> This question will resolve as Yes if, by December 31, 2024, at least 10 countries have ratified an new international treaty on pandemic prevention and preparedness. This question concerns only new treaties, meaning treaties which have not been ratified by any nation as of June 1, 2022.

### Novel Pandemic 

Find the question here: <https://www.metaculus.com/questions/11164/25m-killed-by-pandemic-2022-to-2031/>

> The WHO reported over 6.3 million deaths from COVID-19 as of early June 2022. The true death toll is likely much higher than official records, according to excess mortality figures. One model by The Economist estimates 21.2 million deaths due to COVID-19 as of late May 2022. Excess deaths are calculated by comparing the total deaths reported from all causes to how many deaths would be expected given data from recent years.
> 
> While COVID-19 will continue to impact humanity indefinitely, infectious disease experts are concerned that another pandemic could emerge at anytime.
> 
> There are a variety of factors that could might make a novel pandemic likely, including:
> 
> - The growth of the world population.
- The continuation of factory farming.
-  Climate change increasing cross-species viral transmission risk.
-  Habitat destruction exposing people to new pathogens.
- It becoming increasingly easy to manufacture deadly viruses in the lab.
> The U.S. congress thus far failing to pass pandemic prevention legislation.
> 
> The purpose of this question is to understand the likelihood of a novel pandemic occurring in the coming decade.
> 
> Will there be a novel pathogen that kills over 25 million people between 2022 and 2031 (inclusive)?
> 
> This question will resolve as Yes if at least 25 million people have died from an infectious pathogen (excluding SARS-CoV-2 and its descendants) from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2031, according to excess mortality figures compiled by what Metaculus judges to be the most credible of following sources:
> 
> - The World Health Organisation (or its successor)
- Credible media reports/models
- Academic studies/models
> 
> If there are several reports/models judged credible by Metaculus admins, the resolution will be determined by the median of the reported deaths.
> 
> Descendants of SARS-CoV-2 will not be included for purposes of this question, even if there are new variants that differ substantially from existing circulating variants. New variants of other existing pathogens that have caused pandemics, for instance HIV and TB, would also not count. However, a new strain of influenza that causes a pandemic would count.

### High-risk Labatory Incidents 

Find the question here: <https://www.metaculus.com/questions/11273/number-of-bio-lab-incidents-from-2022-2026/>

> There is an extensive history of laboratory biosecurity incidents, including at high-security laboratories. One paper by Manheim and Lewis (2021) found 71 incidents involving "either accidental or purposeful exposure to, or infection by, a highly infectious pathogenic agent" between 1975 and 2016 (inclusive).
> 
> There are four biosafety levels, each with specific controls for containment of microbes and biological agents based on the nature of the microbes/agents being worked on. The US Department of Health and Human Services describes these four levels:
> 
> > - BSL-1: used to study infectious agents or toxins not known to consistently cause disease in healthy adults.
- BSL-2: used to study moderate-risk infectious agents or toxins that pose a risk if accidentally inhaled, swallowed, or exposed to the skin.
- BSL-3: used to study infectious agents or toxins that may be transmitted through the air and cause potentially lethal infection through inhalation exposure.
- BSL-4: used to study infectious agents or toxins that pose a high risk of aerosol-transmitted laboratory infections and life-threatening disease for which no vaccine or therapy is available.
> 
> The purpose of this question is to understand the risks in laboratory biology work over the coming years, which is important given its potential as a pandemic threat.
> 
> How many high-risk laboratory biosecurity incidents will occur between 2022 and 2026 (inclusive)?
> 
> This question will resolve as the best estimate of the number of human-caused pathogen exposure events at laboratories between January 1, 2022 and December 31, 2026, according to information available by January 1, 2032. If no such estimate is available at that time, Metaculus Admins will attempt to make such an estimate by counting the number of such events.
> 
> For the purposes of this question, we will use the definition of "human-caused pathogen exposure events at laboratories" used by Manheim and Lewis (2019): "involving either accidental or purposeful exposure to, or infection by, a highly infectious pathogenic agent" and that the pathogenic agent is one that is "usable as a bioweapon, or that requires similar safeguards."
