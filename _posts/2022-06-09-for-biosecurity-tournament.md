__Overview__ 

>  Biosecurity Tournament, Prize Pool: $25,000, End Date: Dec 30, 2024
> 
> This first-of-its kind, multi-year biosecurity forecasting tournament was developed in partnership with pandemic preparedness non-profit Guarding Against Pandemics and the research and advocacy think tank the Institute for Progress. The Biosecurity Tournament has three aims: to map out the future biosecurity risk landscape, to help direct resource allocation to the highest-impact interventions, and to inform the distribution of attention and efforts — all with a focus on global catastrophic biological risks (GCBRs).
> 
> The Metaculus Community’s forecasts will be shared with public health experts, informing their decision making and helping to mitigate future COVID-like risks. Guarding Against Pandemics has generously provided a $25,000 prize pool to support forecasting efforts.
> 
> Round 1 of this tournament is open for forecasting, with new questions arriving on 2022-6-16, 2022-6-23, 2022-6-30. We appreciate the forecasting community’s insights and expertise in furthering this critical initiative.
