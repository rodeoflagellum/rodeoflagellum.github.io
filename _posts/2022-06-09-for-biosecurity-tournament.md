__Overview__ 

>  Biosecurity Tournament, Prize Pool: $25,000, End Date: Dec 30, 2024
> 
> This first-of-its kind, multi-year biosecurity forecasting tournament was developed in partnership with pandemic preparedness non-profit Guarding Against Pandemics and the research and advocacy think tank the Institute for Progress. The Biosecurity Tournament has three aims: to map out the future biosecurity risk landscape, to help direct resource allocation to the highest-impact interventions, and to inform the distribution of attention and efforts — all with a focus on global catastrophic biological risks (GCBRs).
> 
> The Metaculus Community’s forecasts will be shared with public health experts, informing their decision making and helping to mitigate future COVID-like risks. Guarding Against Pandemics has generously provided a $25,000 prize pool to support forecasting efforts.
> 
> Round 1 of this tournament is open for forecasting, with new questions arriving on 2022-6-16, 2022-6-23, 2022-6-30. We appreciate the forecasting community’s insights and expertise in furthering this critical initiative.

### Pandemic Prevention and Preparedness 

> The idea of an international treaty on pandemic prevention and preparedness has been recently discussed. According to a March 2021 joint article by leaders of 23 countries as well as President of the European Council and Director-General of the World Health Organisation, the main goal of such a treaty would be to:
> 
    > foster an all of government and all of society approach, strengthening national, regional and global capacities and resilience to future pandemics. This includes greatly enhancing international co-operation to improve, for example, alert systems, data-sharing, research and local, regional and global production and distribution of medical and public health counter-measures such as vaccines, medicines, diagnostics and personal protective equipment.
> 
> According to the European Council, the following are the anticipated next steps of the planned treaty:
> 
    > The intergovernmental negotiating body, tasked with drafting and negotiating this international instrument, will hold its next meeting by 1 August 2022, to discuss progress on a working draft. It will then deliver a progress report to the 76th World Health Assembly in 2023, with the aim to adopt the instrument by 2024.
> 
> The purpose of this question is to understand the potential of this treaty to be adopted.
> 
> Will at least 10 countries ratify a new international treaty on pandemic prevention and preparedness before 2025?
> 
> This question will resolve as Yes if, by December 31, 2024, at least 10 countries have ratified an new international treaty on pandemic prevention and preparedness. This question concerns only new treaties, meaning treaties which have not been ratified by any nation as of June 1, 2022.
