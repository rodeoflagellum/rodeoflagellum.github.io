__Overview__: _In this post, I cover the predictions I've made on resolved questions on websites such as Metaculus, Manifold Markets, etc... I detail how and why my predictions changed as they did, include rationales or comments on why I predicted a certain way, and delimit instances where I had no rationale or made no comments (most instances to date). Moving forward, I would like to post a rationale for every forecast I make. Many times I should not have forecasted on the questions I forecasted on, as I was simply going off of the community's prediction. I've tried to highlight or bring more attention to questions I "took seriously" versus the ones where my System 1 was the primary actor._
