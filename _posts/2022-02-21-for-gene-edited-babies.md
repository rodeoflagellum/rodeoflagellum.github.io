## Designer Babies
_My perspective on having gene-edited children, and a very brief overview of what the bioethics and biotechnology community has to say about "designer babies" and about human gene-editing._

[Henk ten Have][Henk]'s and [Maria do Céu Patrão Neves][Maria]'s 2021 _[Dictionary of Global Bioethics][global_bio]_ offers the following definition of a "[designer baby][wiki_baby]" (pp. 405-406):

> The children of parents who wish to design their offspring are called “designer babies.” The term was coined by the media to refer to genetic interventions in preimplantation human embryos in which the aim was to select or alter the traits future children would have.

Personal Take: As of the last edit date of this post[^1], my partner and I have had on the order of 10 or so discussions about whether we want to have children, and if so, whether we want to do [egg][wiki_egg][^2] or [sperm][wiki_sperm][^3] freezing, [in-vitro fertilization][wiki_IVF][^4], [embryo screening][wiki_emby2][^5], and/or [gene-editing][wiki_geno][^6] of our offspring (assuming we can afford these things and they are available). Neither me nor my partner are very familiar with the costs, benefits, or feasibility of these procedures; we are, however, interested in improving life outcomes in as many ways as possible for our potential progeny.

&emsp; I would like for any children I have to be physically healthy and to be, in the following order of preference, intelligent, conscientious, creative, and amiable, among other things[^7]. My partner is primarily concerned with any children of ours not being bipolar or depressed, and not being prone to taking high risks. Both of us are interested in having genetic-engineering employed to achieve these things, but are still quite uncertain about its practicality. Any children that would be produced by us are at least 5 years away. Will gene-editing be legal? effective? expensive? when we decide to have children? How useful, available, and painless[^8] will polygenic or embryo screening be when we decide to have children? Questions like these further motivate me to forecast on this topic.

&emsp; In considering life outcomes for our children, we try not to neglect the ["nurture"][wiki_nat][^9] or environmental axis of development, but have really not thought deeply about what parenting practices we'd like to adopt, or about other environmental features, such as whether we want children rearing to occur in an urban or rural setting. Regardless, human gene-editing done correctly seems like something that could have tremendous societal benefits, and is something me and my partner presently believe we want for our future children. What about other people?[^10]

Other People's Takes: The [PEW Research Center][PEW] performed a [poll][PEW report]

> This report examines public perceptions of biotechnology, evolution and the relationship between science and religion. Data in this report come from a survey conducted in 20 publics from October 2019 to March 2020 across Europe, Russia, the Americas and the Asia-Pacific region. Surveys were conducted by face-to-face interview in Russia, Poland, the Czech Republic, India and Brazil. In all other places, the surveys were conducted by telephone. All surveys were conducted with representative samples of adults ages 18 and older in each survey public.

that covered this in some form; they found the following

> A 20-public median of 63% say scientific research on gene editing is a misuse – rather than an appropriate use – of technology, according to the survey fielded in publics across Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, the United States, Canada, Brazil and Russia.
>
However, views on specific instances where gene editing might be used highlight the complex and contextual nature of public attitudes. Majorities say it would be appropriate to change a baby’s genetic characteristics to treat a serious disease the baby would have at birth (median of 70%), and somewhat smaller shares, though still about half or more, say using these techniques to reduce the risk of a serious disease that could occur over the course of the baby’s lifetime would be appropriate (60%). But a median of just 14% say it would be appropriate to change a baby’s genetic characteristics to make the baby more intelligent. A far larger share (median of 82%) would consider this to be a misuse of technology.

So, it seems that the majority of polled people oppose gene-editing for enhancement[^11], but support it for treatment. Why is this so? 

## Adoption Scenarios
_Several scenarios I've thought about for how the adoption of human gene-editing might turn out over the coming decades._

[^2]: What is egg freezing, and why is it used? Here is one source's description of egg freezing - UCLA's [Fertility and Reproduction Health Center][UCLA Health] (see [here][eggF]) definition: <br><br> _Egg freezing, or oocyte cryopreservation, is a process in which a woman's eggs (oocytes) are extracted, frozen and stored as a method to preserve reproductive potential in women of reproductive age. The first human birth from a frozen oocyte was reported in 1986. Oocyte cryopreservation has advanced greatly over the past few years, with improved overall success of eggs surviving the freezing process. It is no longer considered an experimental procedure by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. The techniques leading to enhanced gamete survival, potential fertilization and live birth rates allow women a much greater degree of autonomy than was possible even in the past 5 years._

[^3]: What is sperm freezing, and why is it used? Here is one source's description of sperm freezing - the [University of Utah][spermF]'s [Health Care Center][UUtah]'s definition: <br><br> _Sperm cryopreservation or sperm freezing is a way for men to preserve their sperm and store it in a bank so it can be used in the future. Many medical treatments can damage sperm quality, including several types of cancer treatment like chemotherapy and radiation. Some men choose to freeze their sperm before getting medical treatment._

[^7]: There are many qualities that I would like my children to have. Two things concerning this should be noted: 1) the term "qualities" is vague, and the things people routinely associate with them (e.g., intelligence or IQ, OCEAN measures, physical attractiveness, creativity, the absence of disease, the absence of a cognitive ailment, etc...) are typically broad in scope, complex (stemming from the interplay of multiple genes), and lack epistemic consensus (multiple measures or definitions for the phenomenon), so I believe we should presently be weary or causious of optimizing for these qualities, given that humanity's lack of understanding of the biology underlying these things may result in unintended consequences, and 2) my desire for my children to have certain "qualities" is illustrative of the idea that I believe there are genetic traits that are more instrumentally valuable to goals I personally like, and

[^8]: My partner is particularly concerned that the potential complications of batch egg-extraction might not be worth it, should we decide to incorporate embryo screening or gene-editing into our reproductive activities. From the "Complications" section of the [Wikipedia][wiki]'s page on [transvaginal oocyte retrival][wiki_trans]: <br><br> _"Injection of hCG as a trigger for ovulation confers a risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, especially in women with polycystic ovary syndrome who have been hyperstimulated during previous assisted reproduction cycles.[12] <br><br> Complications of TVOR include injury to pelvic organs, hemorrhage, and infection. Occurring more often in lean patients with polycystic ovary syndrome, ovarian hemorrhage after TVOR is a potentially catastrophic and not so rare complication.[13] Additional complications may result from the administration of intravenous sedation or general anesthesia. These include asphyxia caused by airway obstruction, apnea, hypotension, and pulmonary aspiration of stomach contents. <br><br> Propofol-based anesthetic techniques result in significant concentrations of propofol in follicular fluid. As propofol has been shown to have deleterious effects on oocyte fertilization (in a mouse model), some authors have suggested that the dose of propofol administered during anesthesia should be limited, and also that the retrieved oocytes should be washed free of propofol.[14] Anecdotal evidence suggests that certain airborne chemical contaminants and particles, especially volatile organic compounds (VOC), may be toxic to and impair the growth and development of embryos if present in sufficient concentrations in the ambient atmosphere of an IVF incubator.[15][16] <br><br> Endometriosis seems to cause a challenge for TVOR that may have reflection on individual surgeon's performance rates for the procedure, independently from the diameter of a pre-existing ovarian endometrioma (OMA) or ovarian adhesions. Obesity is another factor that may present a challenge for the procedure."_

[^9]: The present consensus on the "nature vs. nurture" debate, along with a general understanding of [heritability][wiki_her], especially work on the [heritability of intelligence][wiki_her_iq], is something that I don't know much about. To alleviate this, I have read the linked [Wikipedia][wiki] pages, and provide revelant sections below.

[^10]: I don't cover people's attitudes towards human gene-editing in detail, but intend to at some point in a Metaculus notebook with the prospective title - _Attitudes Towards Human Gene-Editing_. When/if I write this, I will link to it in this footnote. I expect to develop forecasting questions on this topic that follow along

[^11]: Within the field of [human enhancement][wiki_enh], a distinction is often made between gene-editing for enhancement versus for treatment.
