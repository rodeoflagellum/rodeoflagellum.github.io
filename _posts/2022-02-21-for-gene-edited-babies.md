## Designer Babies
_My perspective on having gene-edited children, and a very brief overview of what the bioethics and biotechnology community has to say about "designer babies" and about human gene-editing._

Personal Take: As of the last edit date of this post[^1], my partner and I have had on the order of 10 or so discussions about whether we want to have children, and if so, whether we want to do [egg][eggF][^2] or [sperm][wiki_sperm][^3] freezing, [in-vitro fertilization][wiki_IVF][^4], [embryo screening][wiki_emby2][^5], and/or [gene-editing][wiki_geno][^6] of our offspring (assuming we can afford these things and they are available). Neither me nor my partner are very familiar with the costs, benefits, or feasibility of these procedures; we are, however, interested in improving life outcomes in as many ways as possible for our potential progeny.

&emsp; I would like for any children I have to be physically healthy and to be, in the following order of preference, intelligent, conscientious, creative, and amiable, among other things[^7]. My partner is primarily concerned with any children of ours not being bipolar or depressed, and not being prone to taking high risks. Both of us are interested in employing genetic-engineering for this purpose, but still

[^1]: Every source accessed and personal take is accurate at least up to the date of last edit (the second date beneath the tags; this date is currently {{ page.last_edit }}).

[^2]: What is egg freezing, and why is it used? Here is one source's description of egg freezing - UCLA's [Fertility and Reproduction Health Center][UCLA Health] (see [here][eggF]) definition: <br><br> _Egg freezing, or oocyte cryopreservation, is a process in which a woman's eggs (oocytes) are extracted, frozen and stored as a method to preserve reproductive potential in women of reproductive age. The first human birth from a frozen oocyte was reported in 1986. Oocyte cryopreservation has advanced greatly over the past few years, with improved overall success of eggs surviving the freezing process. It is no longer considered an experimental procedure by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. The techniques leading to enhanced gamete survival, potential fertilization and live birth rates allow women a much greater degree of autonomy than was possible even in the past 5 years._

[^3]: What is sperm freezing, and why is it used? Here is one source's description of sperm freezing - the [University of Utah][spermF]'s [Health Care Center][UUtah]'s definition: <br><br> _Sperm cryopreservation or sperm freezing is a way for men to preserve their sperm and store it in a bank so it can be used in the future. Many medical treatments can damage sperm quality, including several types of cancer treatment like chemotherapy and radiation. Some men choose to freeze their sperm before getting medical treatment._

[^7]: There are many qualities that I would like my children to have. Two things concerning this should be noted: 1) the term "qualities" is vague, and the things people routinely associate with them (e.g., intelligence or IQ, OCEAN measures, physical attractiveness, creativity, the absence of disease, the absence of a cognitive ailment, etc...) are typically broad in scope, complex (stemming from the interplay of multiple genes), and lack epistemic consensus (multiple measures or definitions for the phenomenon), so I believe we should presently be weary or causious of optimizing for these qualities, given that humanity's lack of understanding of the biology underlying these things may result in unintended consequences, and 2) my desire for my children to have certain "qualities" is illustrative of the idea that I believe there are genetic traits that are more instrumentally valuable to goals I personally like, and
