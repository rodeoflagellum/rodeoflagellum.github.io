## Designer Babies
_My perspective on potentially having gene-edited children, and a very brief overview of what the public and bioethics community have to say about "designer babies" and about human gene-editing._

In the 2021 _[Dictionary of Global Bioethics][global_bio]{:target="_blank"}_, [Henk ten Have][Henk]{:target="_blank"}  and [Maria do Céu Patrão Neves][Maria]{:target="_blank"} 's[^1] offer the following definition of a "[designer baby][Designer Baby, Wikipedia]{:target="_blank"} " (pp. 405-406):

> The children of parents who wish to design their offspring are called “designer babies.” The term was coined by the media to refer to genetic interventions in preimplantation human embryos in which the aim was to select or alter the traits future children would have.

#### *Personal Take*

As of the last edit date of this post[^2], my partner and I have had on the order of 10 or so discussions about whether we want to have children, and if so, whether we want to do [egg][wiki_egg]{:target="_blank"} [^3] or [sperm][wiki_sperm]{:target="_blank"} [^4] freezing, [in-vitro fertilization][wiki_IVF]{:target="_blank"} [^5], [embryo screening][wiki_emby2]{:target="_blank"} [^6], or [gene-editing][wiki_geno]{:target="_blank"} [^7] of our offspring. We operate, in our talks, as though these things are or will be affordable and available to us. Neither me nor my partner are very familiar with the costs, benefits, and feasibility of these procedures; we are, however, interested in improving, in as many ways as possible, the lives of our potential progeny.

&emsp; I would like for any children I have to be physically healthy and to be, in the following order of preference, intelligent, conscientious, creative, and amiable, among other things[^8]. My partner is primarily concerned with her children being bipolar or depressed, or being prone to taking high risks; she doesn't want these things to occur. Both of us are interested in having genetic-engineering employed to achieve these ends, but are still quite uncertain about its practicality. Any children that would be produced by us are at least 5 years away. Will gene-editing be legal? effective? expensive? when we decide to have children? How useful, available, and painless[^9] will polygenic or embryo screening be when we decide to have children? Questions like these further motivate me to forecast on this topic.

&emsp; In considering lives of our children, we try not to neglect the ["nurture"][wiki_nat]{:target="_blank"} [^10] or environmental component of development, but have really not thought deeply about what parenting practices we'd like to adopt, or about other environmental features, such as whether we want our children rearing to occur in an urban or rural setting. Regardless, human gene-editing done correctly seems like something that could have tremendous societal benefits, and is something me and my partner presently believe we want for our future children. What do other people think?[^11]

#### *Public Take*

In 2020, the [PEW Research Center][PEW]{:target="_blank"} performed a [survey][PEW report]{:target="_blank"}[^12] of 20 publics[^13], gauging support for biotechnology and human gene-editing. They found the following:

> A 20-public median of 63% say scientific research on gene editing is a misuse – rather than an appropriate use – of technology, according to the survey fielded in publics across Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, the United States, Canada, Brazil and Russia.
>
However, views on specific instances where gene editing might be used highlight the complex and contextual nature of public attitudes. Majorities say it would be appropriate to change a baby’s genetic characteristics to treat a serious disease the baby would have at birth (median of 70%), and somewhat smaller shares, though still about half or more, say using these techniques to reduce the risk of a serious disease that could occur over the course of the baby’s lifetime would be appropriate (60%). But a median of just 14% say it would be appropriate to change a baby’s genetic characteristics to make the baby more intelligent. A far larger share (median of 82%) would consider this to be a misuse of technology.

<!-- ![](/assets/images/pew2020.png) -->

Generally, the survey indicates that those who are male, those who are the median age or younger, and those who are more educated are more supportive of human gene-editing; I believe these properties are fairly robust, and don't expect them to change much in the coming years.

&emsp; I believe that the current median sentiment for whether gene-editing research is a misuse has likely not strayed far from 63% median of 2020, given that I am someone who is fairly interested in gene-editing and who actively monitors research activity on it and, despite this, that I have not heard much in the mainstream news in support of or against gene-editing. Support for using gene-editing for treatment[^14], be it for illness at birth (median 70% support) or illness over lifespan (median 60% support), is something that I also don't expect to have changed much. I believe that any change in sentiment would be in the direction of further support.

&emsp; A final and highly intriguing note on the public perception's of gene-editing is that, above all other publics surveyed, India stands out as most readily accepting of human gene-editing, with 56% of adults (highest percentage measured in the survey; the next highest was South Korea at 47%, Taiwan at 44%, and Singapore at 38%) considering research on gene-editing to not be a misuse of science. In terms of using gene-editing for [human enhancement][wiki_enh]{:target="_blank"}, India stands out even more, with 64% of respondents supporting changing a baby's genetic characteristics to increase intelligence (Malaysia came next at 44%, and then Taiwan at 31%). This indicates to me that, while India might not be the first nation to legalize human gene-editing, it might be the largest market for both treatment and enhancement uses of gene-editing, which is something that might lead to it becoming, at some point, the nation with the most gene-edited babies.

#### *Bioethicists' Take*

While I am not too familiar with the history of [eugenics][wiki_eug]{:target="_blank"}, my current intuition is that most researchers whose work might fall within the fields of genetics, gene-editing, CRISPR-Cas9, heritability, etc... are incentivized to dissociate themselves from the term _eugenics_ and, partly because of this, [appeal to ridicule][wiki_rid]{:target="_blank"} in their assessments of the long-term prospects of human gene-editing for enhancement purposes. For treatment purposes, I think that bioethicists might be more split. Ever since the [He Jiankui affair][wiki_he]{:target="_blank"}, where [He Jiankui][wiki_he2]{:target="_blank"} of the  [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)][wiki_so]{:target="_blank"} in [Shenzhen][wiki_shen]{:target="_blank"} used [CRISPR-Cas9][wiki_cri]{:target="_blank"} to genetically modify a set of embryos, which ultimately lead to three gene-edited babies being born, bioethicists seem to have taken, generally, a firm stance against gene-editing in humans.

&emsp; Following the He Jiankui affair, the World Health Organization recommended discontinuing applying human germline genome editing for the time being in their [26 July 2019 statement][who_19]{:target="_blank"}:

> The WHO expert advisory committee on governance and oversight of human genome editing convened on 18-19 March 2019.  At this meeting the Committee in an interim recommendation to the WHO Director-general stated that “it would be irresponsible at this time for anyone to proceed with clinical applications of human germline genome editing.”

In the WHO's Expert Advisory Committee on Developing Global Standards for Governance and Oversight of Human Genome Editing 2021 report - [Human Genome Editing: Recommendations][who_21]{:target="_blank"} - the following stance on human germline genome editing was offered:

> Human genome editing has great potential to improve human health and medicine. Human genome editing technologies can be used on somatic cells (non-heritable); germline cells (not for reproduction) and germline cells (for reproduction). Potential benefits of human genome editing include new strategies for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of genetic disorders; new avenues to treat infertility; new ways to promote disease resistance; contribution to vaccine development and enhanced knowledge of human biology. For example, application of somatic human genome editing has already been undertaken, including in vivo editing, to address HIV, sickle-cell disease and transthyretin amyloidosis1. Germline human genome editing contributes to deepen our understanding of the role of specific genes and processes in early human development, physiology and diseases. However, there are important areas of ongoing uncertainty as to potential benefits and risks, and gaps in scientific understanding in such key domains as off target effects and long-term risks.
>
At the same time, however, somatic, germline and heritable human genome editing raise important and outstanding ethical and social issues. Challenges associated with somatic human genome editing include, for example, rogue clinics, medical travel, as well as the reporting of illegal, unregistered, unethical or unsafe research and other activities including the offer of unproven so-called therapeutic interventions. Heritable human genome editing also gives rise to great concerns as the edit might be passed to subsequent generations. Additional issues include enhancement to improve certain traits, the lack of diversity in collections of human samples and associated data, the need for equity of access to and benefit from human genome editing. There are important differences in the scale of the current challenges posed by somatic, germline and heritable human genome editing.

The [National Human Genome Research Institute][nat_gen]{:target="_blank"} (NHGRI) takes a similar stances, i.e. a stance that acknowledges the high expected societal value of human gene-editing, but which places immense weight on considering all deleterious societal and biological consequences that might emerge as as a result. In the NHGRI's [Eugenics timeline][eug_tim]{:target="_blank"}, they write

> Recently, groundbreaking technologies such as CRISPR-Cas9, have raised concerns about using genome editing methods to make genetic enhancements. In response, some prominent geneticists have publicly requested to stop such enhancements.
>
Eugenics remains a constant issue in society and the scientific community, and the NHGRI is committed to monitoring its presence and confronting its inaccuracies.

One might suggest that the official statements of the WHO's or NHGRI's boards fail to capture the majority sentiments of the researchers with the technical capacity to edit human genomes or of those who work adjacent to such researchers. The paper _[Attitudes of Members of Genetics Professional Societies Toward Human Gene Editing][pub_at]{:target="_blank"}_ details the results of a 2017 online survey given to those with "genetics training"; it's abstract:

> Gene-editing technologies have improved in ease, efficiency, and precision. Although discussions are occurring around acceptable uses of human gene editing, limited data exist on the views of genetics-trained individuals. In 2017, we distributed an anonymous online survey to assess the attitudes of members of genetics professional societies toward gene editing (N = 500). Virtually all respondents were supportive of somatic editing in basic- science (99.2%) and clinical (87.4%) research on nonreproductive human cells. Only 57.2% were supportive of germline-editing basic-science research; 31.9% supported the transfer of viable embryos to humans for clinical research. While most favored future therapeutic uses of somatic (96.6%) and germline (77.8%) editing, there was little support for enhancement in somatic (13.0%) or germline (8.6%) cells. This study describes attitudes toward gene editing from genetics professionals worldwide and contributes to ongoing discourse and policy guidance in this domain.

Note that this survey[^15] occurred before the He Jiankui affair. I'm unsure as to how opinions have changed since then, but believe they very likely haven't changed by much. Imagine being in the following situation: ```It's 2017. You have genetics-training and believe human gene-editing for enhancement purposes is entirely valid (the whole deal - intelligence, attractiveness, hair color, etc...). A researcher in China oversteps current ethical boundaries, producing 3 gene-edited humans and shifting the window of social acceptability of human gene-editing more towards it being perceived as "deplorable", "a misuse of science", etc... Do you stop believing human gene-editing for enhancement purposes is entirely valid?``` I don't think so; I think such an individual would simply avoid publicly advocating for human gene-editing for enhancement purposes, out of concern for funding and [social desirability][wiki_soc]{:target="_blank"}. I'm getting ahead of myself...what did those researchers believe in 2017? Well, before getting to this, what were the 500 people polled like?

_Demographics_

![](/assets/images/design_babies_p1/GenEn_AttitudesDemo_2017.png)

The opinions of interest (at least to me) are those of the 36 clinical laboratory scientists, 148 research scientists, and 17 ELSI[^16] researchers, but the paper does not partition the results by Profession, which I find unfortunate.

_Opinions on the Acceptability of Human Gene-Editing_

![](/assets/images/design_babies_p1/GenEn_AttitudesOpinions_2017.png)

_Opinions on Different Uses of Human Gene-Editing_

![](/assets/images/design_babies_p1/GenEn_AttitudesOpinions2_2017.jpg)

If we take this opinion landscape to generalize well to other people with genetics-training and to not have changed very much since 2017, then it seems that the stance that people with genetics training take on human gene-editing is _slightly_ more permissive of human enhancement than . The picture is incomplete to me, as I am generalizing my fractional perspective of the WHO's and NHGRI's positions on human gene-editing to other organizations with authority over genetic-engineering research activities.

## Page Epistemics

#### *Status*

__"Working Draft"__: I don't believe I will make many more edits to the content of this page in the coming years. I will likely only alter the web-components of this page (e.g., collecting all URLs on the page to generate a link bibliography). Outside of alterations, what I have stands as a working attempt to forecast how many gene-edited humans there will be by the years 2029, 2049, and 2100.

#### *Certainty*

__"Somewhat Likely"__: This means I am around 60% confident in the accuracy or thoroughness of my content. I think my personal take is on point, but that the public and bioethicist takes are very incomplete (I have not done an extensive search of all bioethics surveys or reports). For the scenarios, I think.

Here is one source's description of egg freezing - UCLA's [Fertility and Reproduction Health Center][UCLA Health] (see [here][eggF]) definition: <br><br> _Egg freezing, or oocyte cryopreservation, is a process in which a woman's eggs (oocytes) are extracted, frozen and stored as a method to preserve reproductive potential in women of reproductive age. The first human birth from a frozen oocyte was reported in 1986. Oocyte cryopreservation has advanced greatly over the past few years, with improved overall success of eggs surviving the freezing process. It is no longer considered an experimental procedure by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. The techniques leading to enhanced gamete survival, potential fertilization and live birth rates allow women a much greater degree of autonomy than was possible even in the past 5 years._

[^8]: There are many qualities that I would like my children to have. Two things concerning this should be noted: 1) the term "qualities" is vague, and the things people routinely associate with them (e.g., intelligence or IQ, OCEAN measures, physical attractiveness, creativity, the absence of disease, the absence of a cognitive ailment, etc...) are typically broad in scope, complex (stemming from the interplay of multiple genes), and lack epistemic consensus (multiple measures or definitions for the phenomenon), so I believe we should presently be weary or causious of optimizing for these qualities, given that humanity's lack of understanding of the biology underlying these things may result in unintended consequences, and 2) my desire for my children to have certain "qualities" is illustrative of the idea that I believe there are genetic traits that are more instrumentally valuable to goals I personally like, and

[^9]: My partner is particularly concerned that the potential complications of batch egg-extraction might not be worth it, should we decide to incorporate embryo screening or gene-editing into our reproductive activities. From the "Complications" section of the [Wikipedia][wiki]'s page on [transvaginal oocyte retrival][wiki_trans]: <br><br> _"Injection of hCG as a trigger for ovulation confers a risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, especially in women with polycystic ovary syndrome who have been hyperstimulated during previous assisted reproduction cycles.[12] <br><br> Complications of TVOR include injury to pelvic organs, hemorrhage, and infection. Occurring more often in lean patients with polycystic ovary syndrome, ovarian hemorrhage after TVOR is a potentially catastrophic and not so rare complication.[13] Additional complications may result from the administration of intravenous sedation or general anesthesia. These include asphyxia caused by airway obstruction, apnea, hypotension, and pulmonary aspiration of stomach contents. <br><br> Propofol-based anesthetic techniques result in significant concentrations of propofol in follicular fluid. As propofol has been shown to have deleterious effects on oocyte fertilization (in a mouse model), some authors have suggested that the dose of propofol administered during anesthesia should be limited, and also that the retrieved oocytes should be washed free of propofol.[14] Anecdotal evidence suggests that certain airborne chemical contaminants and particles, especially volatile organic compounds (VOC), may be toxic to and impair the growth and development of embryos if present in sufficient concentrations in the ambient atmosphere of an IVF incubator.[15][16] <br><br> Endometriosis seems to cause a challenge for TVOR that may have reflection on individual surgeon's performance rates for the procedure, independently from the diameter of a pre-existing ovarian endometrioma (OMA) or ovarian adhesions. Obesity is another factor that may present a challenge for the procedure."_

[^10]: The present consensus on the "nature vs. nurture" debate, along with a general understanding of [heritability][wiki_her], especially work on the [heritability of intelligence][wiki_her_iq], is something that I don't know much about. To alleviate this, I have read the linked [Wikipedia][wiki] pages, and provide revelant sections below.

[^11]: I don't cover people's attitudes towards human gene-editing in detail, but intend to at some point in a Metaculus notebook with the prospective title - _Attitudes Towards Human Gene-Editing_. When/if I write this, I will link to it in this footnote. I expect to develop forecasting questions on this topic that follow along

[^12]: The PEW Research survey's explanation for _How we did this?_: <br><br> "This report examines public perceptions of biotechnology, evolution and the relationship between science and religion. Data in this report come from a survey conducted in 20 publics from October 2019 to March 2020 across Europe, Russia, the Americas and the Asia-Pacific region. Surveys were conducted by face-to-face interview in Russia, Poland, the Czech Republic, India and Brazil. In all other places, the surveys were conducted by telephone. All surveys were conducted with representative samples of adults ages 18 and older in each survey public."

[^13]: The 20 publics are [Australia, Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, United Kingdom, United States]. For each public, there are 100 respondents per question, but I do not know whether this means that there are 100 total respondents per public, or that there are 100 x n total respondents, where n is the number of questions. For the survey's methodology, see [here][PEW_meth]

[^14]: Within the field of [human enhancement][wiki_enh], a distinction is often made between gene-editing for enhancement versus for treatment.

[^15]: After a quick first-pass search, I was not able to find any other surveys on the opinions of bioethicists or people with genetics training towards human gene-editing. Originally when writing this, I could have refrained from including the WHO's and NHGRI's stances on human germline genome editing, but after failing to find the opinion polls I was looking for, decided that they might be useful for presenting governance of human gene-editing, i.e. the stances of some organizations controlling the research guidelines and policies for human gene-editing that actually affect scientists' activities.
