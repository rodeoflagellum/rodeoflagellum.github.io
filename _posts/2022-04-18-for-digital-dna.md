[wiki_E_age]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Earth "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Earth"

[^Eage]: _...roughly 4.54 billion years old_: Dalrymple, G. Brent. "The age of the Earth in the twentieth century: a problem (mostly) solved." Geological Society, London, Special Publications 190, no. 1 (2001): 205-221. See <https://creationismonline.com/YEC/Dalrymple_B.pdf>. Quote: (pp.1) "...the first calculation by Patterson in 1953 of a valid age for the Earth of 4.55Ga, using the primordial meteoritic lead composition and samples representing the composition of modern Earth lead. The value for the age of the Earth in wide use today was determined by Tera in 1980, who found a value of 4.54 Ga from a clever analysis of the lead isotopic compositions of four ancient conformable lead deposits. Whether this age represents the age of the Earth's accretion, of core formation, or of the material from which the Earth formed is not yet known, but recent evidence suggests it may approximate the latter."

[^Eage2]: _...roughly 4.54 billion years old_: Manhes, Gérard, Claude J. Allègre, Bernard Dupré, and Bruno Hamelin. "Lead isotope study of basic-ultrabasic layered complexes: Speculations about the age of the earth and primitive mantle characteristics." Earth and Planetary Science Letters 47, no. 3 (1980): 370-382. Quote: (pp.1) "If these two bodies are considered as pieces of a “primitive” closed-system mantle, a4.55 ± 0.01 age of the earth can be calculated from their Pb initial ratios."

[^rnaW]: _this hypothesis is called the RNA World Hypothesis, and posits that RNA preceded proteins and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)_: Cech, Thomas R. "The RNA worlds in context." Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in biology 4, no. 7 (2012): a006742. See <https://cshperspectives.cshlp.org/content/4/7/a006742.full.pdf>. Quote: (pp.1) "Did an RNA world exist? Some of the most persuasive arguments in favor of an RNA world are as follows. First, RNA is both an informational molecule and a biocata- lyst—both genotype and phenotype—whereas protein has extremely limited ability to transmit information (as with prions). Thus, RNA should be capable of replicating itself, and indeed RNA can perform the sort of chemistry required for RNA replication (Cech 1986). Second, it is more parsimonious to conceive of a single type of molecule replicating itself than to posit that two different molecules (such as a nucleic acid and a protein capable of replicating that nucleic acid) were synthesized by random chemical reactions in the same place at the same time. Third, the ribosome uses RNA catalysis to perform the key activity of protein synthesis in all extant organisms, so it must have done so in the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA). Fourth, other catalytic activities of RNA—activities that RNA would need in an RNA world but that have not been found in contemporary RNAs—are generally already present in large combinatorial libraries of RNA sequences and can be discovered by SELEX. Fifth, RNA clearly preceded DNA, because multiple enzymes are dedicated to the biosynthesis of the ribonucleotide precursors of RNA, whereas deoxyribonucleotide biosynthesis is derivative of ribonucleotide synthesis, requiring only two additional enzymatic activities (thymidylate synthase and ribonucleotide reductase.) Finally, a primordial RNA world has the attractive feature of continuity; it could evolve into contemporary biology by the sort of events that are well precedented, whereas it is unclear how a self-replicating system based on completely unrelated chemistry could have been supplanted by RNA."

For those presently unaware, radiometric dating research places the [age of the Earth][wiki_E_age] at roughly 4.54 billion years old[^Eage]<sup>,</sup>[^Eage2], which is approximately equal to 56.75 million non-overlapping 80-year human lives. The first microorganisms appeared between "at least 3770 and possibly 4290 million years..." ago[^early]. While the [history][timeline_of_life] and [emergence][abio] of life on Earth [began][life_began] is still the focus of major investigation, ribonucleic acid (RNA) is current believed to have been the original auto-self-replicating system required for the development of early life; this hypothesis is called the [RNA World Hypothesis][rna_world], and posits that RNA preceded proteins and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)[^rnaW].

To learn about DNA digital data storage, I began by searching "dna digital data storage" on FireFox, and reading the following:

- _DNA digital data storage_ Wikipedia page: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_digital_data_storage>
- DNA Data Storage, Wyss Institute: <https://wyss.harvard.edu/technology/dna-data-storage/>
- DNA as a digital information storage device: hope or hype? <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5935598/>
- A primer on DNA data storage and its potential uses: <https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/feature/A-primer-on-DNA-data-storage-and-its-potential-uses>

Following this, I went through the first 10 pages of Google Scholar results for "DNA Digital Data Storage" without citations, and skimmed some results and read others. Listed below are my notes on some papers I've looked through, along with the extent I've looked through them.
