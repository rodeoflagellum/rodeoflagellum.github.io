[^Eage]: _...roughly 4.54 billion years old_: Dalrymple, G. Brent. "The age of the Earth in the twentieth century: a problem (mostly) solved." Geological Society, London, Special Publications 190, no. 1 (2001): 205-221. See <https://creationismonline.com/YEC/Dalrymple_B.pdf>. Quote: (pp.1) "...the first calculation by Patterson in 1953 of a valid age for the Earth of
4.55Ga, using the primordial meteoritic lead composition and samples representing the
composition of modern Earth lead. The value for the age of the Earth in wide use today was
determined by Tera in 1980, who found a value of 4.54 Ga from a clever analysis of the lead
isotopic compositions of four ancient conformable lead deposits. Whether this age repre-
sents the age of the Earth's accretion, of core formation, or of the material from which the
Earth formed is not yet known, but recent evidence suggests it may approximate the latter."

[^Eage2]: _...roughly 4.54 billion years old_: Manhes, Gérard, Claude J. Allègre, Bernard Dupré, and Bruno Hamelin. "Lead isotope study of basic-ultrabasic layered complexes: Speculations about the age of the earth and primitive mantle characteristics." Earth and Planetary Science Letters 47, no. 3 (1980): 370-382. Quote: (pp.1) "If these two bodies are considered as pieces of a “primitive” closed-system mantle, a4.55 ± 0.01 age of the earth can be calculated from their Pb initial ratios."

Radiometric dating research places the [age of the Earth][wiki_E_age] at roughly 4.54 billion years old[^Eage,^Eage2], which is approximately equal to 56.75 million non-overlapping 80-year human lives. How the [history of life][timeline_of_life] on Earth [began][life_began] is still being figured out; however, the first microorganisms appeared between "at least 3770 and possibly 4290 million years..." ago[^early].

See <https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1536298/1/Dodd_et_al_2017_Nature_accepted.pdf>. Quote: (pp.1) "Here we report putative fossilised microorganisms at least 3770 and possibly 4290 million years old in ferruginous sedimentary rocks, interpreted as seafloor-hydrothermal vent-related precipitates, from the Nuvvuagittuq belt in Canada."

To learn about DNA digital data storage, I began by searching "dna digital data storage" on FireFox, and reading the following:

- _DNA digital data storage_ Wikipedia page: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_digital_data_storage>
    - Idea: Encode/decode binary data into DNA, which has high storage potential (__Q__: how much?)
    - Problem: High cost (__Q__: how much?), slow encode/decode times (__Q__: how bad?) 
    - Event: 2019, 16 GB Wiki. En. stored in synthetic DNA. 
    - Event: 2021, able to write data into DNA at 18 Mbps.
    - Idea: Cell free vs. In vivo (__Q__: visualization?, explore these) = (Illumina dye sequencing, nanopores vs. CRISPR to make "molecular recorders")
    - Benchmark: 99.3% acc. in 2016 and 99.9999% acc. in 2022 for cell free mechanism

- DNA Data Storage, Wyss Institute: <https://wyss.harvard.edu/technology/dna-data-storage/>
- DNA as a digital information storage device: hope or hype? <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5935598/>
- A primer on DNA data storage and its potential uses: <https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/feature/A-primer-on-DNA-data-storage-and-its-potential-uses>

Following this, I went through the first 10 pages of Google Scholar results for "DNA Digital Data Storage" without citations, and skimmed some results and read others. Listed below are my notes on some papers I've looked through, along with the extent I've looked through them.
