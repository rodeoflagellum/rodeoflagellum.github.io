[wiki_E_age]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Earth "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Earth"

[^Eage]: _...roughly 4.54 billion years old_: Dalrymple, G. Brent. "The age of the Earth in the twentieth century: a problem (mostly) solved." Geological Society, London, Special Publications 190, no. 1 (2001): 205-221. See <https://creationismonline.com/YEC/Dalrymple_B.pdf>. Quote: (pp.1) "...the first calculation by Patterson in 1953 of a valid age for the Earth of 4.55Ga, using the primordial meteoritic lead composition and samples representing the composition of modern Earth lead. The value for the age of the Earth in wide use today was determined by Tera in 1980, who found a value of 4.54 Ga from a clever analysis of the lead isotopic compositions of four ancient conformable lead deposits. Whether this age represents the age of the Earth's accretion, of core formation, or of the material from which the Earth formed is not yet known, but recent evidence suggests it may approximate the latter."

[^Eage2]: _...roughly 4.54 billion years old_: Manhes, Gérard, Claude J. Allègre, Bernard Dupré, and Bruno Hamelin. "Lead isotope study of basic-ultrabasic layered complexes: Speculations about the age of the earth and primitive mantle characteristics." Earth and Planetary Science Letters 47, no. 3 (1980): 370-382. Quote: (pp.1) "If these two bodies are considered as pieces of a “primitive” closed-system mantle, a4.55 ± 0.01 age of the earth can be calculated from their Pb initial ratios."

[rna_world]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_world "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_world"

[^rnaW]: _this hypothesis is called the RNA World Hypothesis, and posits that RNA preceded proteins and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)_: Cech, Thomas R. "The RNA worlds in context." Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in biology 4, no. 7 (2012): a006742. See <https://cshperspectives.cshlp.org/content/4/7/a006742.full.pdf>. Quote: (pp.1) "Did an RNA world exist? Some of the most persuasive arguments in favor of an RNA world are as follows. First, RNA is both an informational molecule and a biocata- lyst—both genotype and phenotype—whereas protein has extremely limited ability to transmit information (as with prions). Thus, RNA should be capable of replicating itself, and indeed RNA can perform the sort of chemistry required for RNA replication (Cech 1986). Second, it is more parsimonious to conceive of a single type of molecule replicating itself than to posit that two different molecules (such as a nucleic acid and a protein capable of replicating that nucleic acid) were synthesized by random chemical reactions in the same place at the same time. Third, the ribosome uses RNA catalysis to perform the key activity of protein synthesis in all extant organisms, so it must have done so in the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA). Fourth, other catalytic activities of RNA—activities that RNA would need in an RNA world but that have not been found in contemporary RNAs—are generally already present in large combinatorial libraries of RNA sequences and can be discovered by SELEX. Fifth, RNA clearly preceded DNA, because multiple enzymes are dedicated to the biosynthesis of the ribonucleotide precursors of RNA, whereas deoxyribonucleotide biosynthesis is derivative of ribonucleotide synthesis, requiring only two additional enzymatic activities (thymidylate synthase and ribonucleotide reductase.) Finally, a primordial RNA world has the attractive feature of continuity; it could evolve into contemporary biology by the sort of events that are well precedented, whereas it is unclear how a self-replicating system based on completely unrelated chemistry could have been supplanted by RNA." 

[abio]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis"

For those currently unaware, radiometric dating research places the [age of the Earth][wiki_E_age] at roughly 4.54 billion years old[^Eage]<sup>,</sup>[^Eage2], which is approximately equal to 56.75 million non-overlapping 80-year human lives. The first microorganisms appeared between "at least 3770 and possibly 4290 million years..." ago[^early]. While the [history][timeline_of_life] and [emergence][abio] of life on Earth [began][life_began] is still the focus of major investigation, ribonucleic acid (RNA) is current believed to have been the original auto-self-replicating system required for the development of early life; this hypothesis is called the [RNA World Hypothesis][rna_world], and posits that RNA preceded proteins and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)[^rnaW]. Presently, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), the other major nucleic acid, rather than RNA, is the platform for the genetic-material of all cells on Earth today[^cell_book]. 

[earliest_life]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earliest_known_life_forms "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earliest_known_life_forms" 

[^early]: _the first microorganisms appeared between "at least 3770 and possibly 4290 million years..."_ : Dodd, Matthew S., Dominic Papineau, Tor Grenne, John F. Slack, Martin Rittner, Franco Pirajno, Jonathan O’Neil, and Crispin TS Little. "Evidence for early life in Earth’s oldest hydrothermal vent precipitates." Nature 543, no. 7643 (2017): 60-64. See <https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1536298/1/Dodd_et_al_2017_Nature_accepted.pdf>. Quote: (pp.1) "Here we report putative fossilised microorganisms at least 3770 and possibly 4290 million years old in ferruginous sedimentary rocks, interpreted as seafloor-hydrothermal vent-related precipitates, from the Nuvvuagittuq belt in Canada."

[^cell_book]: _...deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), the other major nucleic acid, rather than RNA, is the platform for the genetic-material of all cells on Earth today_: Cooper, Geoffrey M., Robert E. Hausman, and Robert E. Hausman. The cell: a molecular approach. Vol. 8. Washington, DC, USA:: ASM press, 2007. Quote: (pp.6) "As discussed further in Chapter 4, all present-day cells use DNA as the genetic material and employ the same basic mechanisms for DNA replication and expression of the genetic information. Genes are the functional units of inheritance, corresponding to segments of DNA that encode proteins or RNA molecules. The nucleotide sequence of a gene is copied into RNA by a process called transcription. For RNAs that encode proteins, their nucleotide sequence is then used to specify the order of amino acids in a protein by a process called translation."

This brings us to the question of what RNA and DNA actually are. Rather than answer this myself, I default to the writers on Wikipedia (as of 06/09/2022), who have done a much better job at providing a comprehensive definition of RNA and DNA than I could have[^alt_def_rna]<sup>,</sup>[^alt_def_dna]:

[wiki_dogma]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology"

RNA and DNA are both nucleic acids, and are main storage mechanisms of information storage in cells. The [central dogma of molecular biology][wiki_dogma] ensapsulates, from a broad lens, the interactions between DNA, RNA, and proteins in living organisms in terms of information transfer. As originally stated by Francis Crick[^dogma]:

[^dogma]: _As originally stated by Francis Crick_: Crick, Francis HC. "On protein synthesis." In Symp Soc Exp Biol, vol. 12, no. 138-63, p. 8. 1958. See <https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/31353481/Symp_Soc_Exp_Biol_1958_Crick_on_protein_synthesis-with-cover-page-v2.pdf?Expires=1654880735&Signature=glAwa258T3TTy4fxqd-~07IsWvg0joqi7rzuDePEqjj3xoixZjKxxDbzPjHObOFlSS3YfLLShkkK1c7PcrdbWD7UkW~WyKJaCBlYBCoLN9gqfRSpqbR0di7tyY~x6k0pu1jhne7hVEAlGROYtP47~5KPRTFAsQj4Sr6Vif2I9jADAMGXi06AClr~AgqBFZqQ~vvIUwpS8po7WOx52su9Lf2KCtaEUwPVPhD1cvox0di8aN4IVjDsxLKFSgL0grDOvvpK-OPk5acCnll3XTRjrOjcVf4l3yW8tC6iDihmBh4Lh3ET4EhPtDZk3IYsQjTPTP2ZauV6W6uvuNKasm~LCQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA>. Quote: (pp.153). 

> The Central Dogma. This states that once "information" has passed into protein it cannot get out again. In more detail, the transfer of information from nucleic acid to nucleic acid, or from nucleic acid to protein may be possible, but transfer from protein to protein, or from protein to nucleic acid is impossible. Information means here the precise determination of sequence, either of bases in the nucleic acid or of amino acid residues in the protein. 

Generally, RNA is not as stable as DNA and is involved directly in the synthesis of proteins from

To learn about DNA digital data storage, I began by searching "dna digital data storage" on FireFox, and reading the following:

- _DNA digital data storage_ Wikipedia page: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_digital_data_storage>
- DNA Data Storage, Wyss Institute: <https://wyss.harvard.edu/technology/dna-data-storage/>
- DNA as a digital information storage device: hope or hype? <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5935598/>
- A primer on DNA data storage and its potential uses: <https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/feature/A-primer-on-DNA-data-storage-and-its-potential-uses>

Following this, I went through the first 10 pages of Google Scholar results for "DNA Digital Data Storage" without citations, and skimmed some results and read others. Listed below are my notes on some papers I've looked through, along with the extent I've looked through them.
