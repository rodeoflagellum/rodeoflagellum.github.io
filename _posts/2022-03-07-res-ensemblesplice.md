#### *Status*

__"Working Draft"__: I don't believe I will make many more edits to the content of this page in the coming years. I will likely only alter the web-components of this page (e.g., collecting all URLs on the page to generate a link bibliography). Outside of alterations, what I have stands as a working attempt to forecast how many gene-edited humans there will be by the years 2029, 2049, and 2100.

#### *Certainty*

__"Somewhat Likely"__: This means I am around 60% confident in the accuracy or thoroughness of my content. I think my personal take is on point, but that the public and bioethicist takes are very incomplete (I have not done an extensive search of all bioethics surveys or reports). For the scenarios, I think.
