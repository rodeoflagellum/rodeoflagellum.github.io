## Gene-Edited Humans
_My perspective on potentially having gene-edited children, and a very brief overview of what the public and bioethics community have to say about "designer babies" and about human gene-editing._

In the 2021 _[Dictionary of Global Bioethics][global_bio]{:target="_blank"}_, [Henk ten Have][Henk]{:target="_blank"}  and [Maria do Céu Patrão Neves][Maria]{:target="_blank"} 's[^1] offer the following definition of a "[designer baby][Designer Baby, Wikipedia]{:target="_blank"}" (pp. 405-406):

> The children of parents who wish to design their offspring are called “designer babies.” The term was coined by the media to refer to genetic interventions in preimplantation human embryos in which the aim was to select or alter the traits future children would have.

#### *Personal Take*

As of the last edit date of this post[^2], my partner and I have had on the order of 10 or so discussions about whether we want to have children, and if so, whether we want to have our [eggs][wiki_egg]{:target="_blank"}[^3] or [sperm][wiki_sperm]{:target="_blank"}[^4] frozen, have [in-vitro fertilization][wiki_IVF]{:target="_blank"}[^5], have our [embryos screened][wiki_emby2]{:target="_blank"}[^6], or have our children [genetically edited][wiki_geno]{:target="_blank"}[^7]. We operate, in our talks, as though these things are or will be affordable and available to us. Neither me nor my partner are very familiar with the costs, benefits, and feasibility of these procedures; we are, however, interested in improving, in as many ways as possible, the lives of our potential progeny.

&emsp; I would like for any children I have to be physically healthy and to be, in the following order of preference, highly intelligent, conscientious, creative, and amiable, among other things[^8]. My partner is primarily concerned with her children being bipolar or depressed, or being prone to taking dangerous risks; she doesn't want these things to occur. Both of us are interested in having genetic-engineering employed to achieve these ends, but are still quite uncertain about its practicality. Any children that would be produced by us are at least 5 years away. Will gene-editing be legal? effective? expensive? when we decide to have children? How useful, available, and painless[^9] will polygenic or embryo screening be? These questions and others similar motivate me to forecast on this topic.

&emsp; In considering the lives of our children, my partner and I tried not to neglect exploring the ["nurture"][wiki_nat]{:target="_blank"} [^10] or environmental component of development, but have really not thought deeply about what parenting practices we'd like to adopt, or about other environmental features, such as whether we want to raise our children in an urban or rural setting. Regardless, human gene-editing done correctly seems like something that could benefit society extensively, and is something me and my partner presently believe we want for our future children. What do other people think?[^11]

#### *Public Take*

In 2020, the [PEW Research Center][PEW]{:target="_blank"} performed a [survey][PEW report]{:target="_blank"}[^12] of 20 publics[^13] in an attempt to gauge global support for biotechnology research, and to observe how religion affected people's approval. Regarding human gene-editing, they found the following:

> A 20-public median of 63% say scientific research on gene editing is a misuse – rather than an appropriate use – of technology, according to the survey fielded in publics across Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, the United States, Canada, Brazil and Russia.
>
However, views on specific instances where gene editing might be used highlight the complex and contextual nature of public attitudes. Majorities say it would be appropriate to change a baby’s genetic characteristics to treat a serious disease the baby would have at birth (median of 70%), and somewhat smaller shares, though still about half or more, say using these techniques to reduce the risk of a serious disease that could occur over the course of the baby’s lifetime would be appropriate (60%). But a median of just 14% say it would be appropriate to change a baby’s genetic characteristics to make the baby more intelligent. A far larger share (median of 82%) would consider this to be a misuse of technology.

<!-- ![](/assets/images/pew2020.png) -->

So, it appears that a majority of people approve human gene-editing for treatment purposes, and most people disapprove of gene-editing for enhancement[^14].

&emsp; The remainder of the survey is worth looking over, and generally indicates that those who are male, those who are the median age or younger, and those who are more educated are more supportive of human gene-editing, which are properties that I believe are fairly robust, i.e. I  don't expect them to have changed much since 2020, and don't expect them to change much in the coming years. Any change in these sentiments (in 2020, median 63% believe gene-editing research is a misuse, and median 70% and median 60% support for using gene-editing for treating illness at birth and illness over lifespan, respectively) I believe will be in the direction of more support; I expect human gene-editing to become safer, more effective, etc... as it is researched more and also I expect religion to continue declining (it [seems to be declining][relg_dec][^15]), both of which will very likely ease global ill-perceptions of human gene-editing. I do suspect I may be [overly optimist][wiki_opt] in this regard though.

&emsp; A final and highly intriguing note on the public perception's of gene-editing is that, above all other publics surveyed, India stands out as most readily accepting of human gene-editing, with 56% of adults (highest percentage measured in the survey; the next highest was South Korea at 47%, Taiwan at 44%, and Singapore at 38%) considering research on gene-editing to not be a misuse of science. In terms of using gene-editing for [human enhancement][wiki_enh]{:target="_blank"}, India stands out even more, with 64% of respondents supporting changing a baby's genetic characteristics to increase intelligence (Malaysia came next at 44%, and then Taiwan at 31%). This indicates to me that while India might not be the first nation to legalize human gene-editing, it might eventually be the largest market for both treatment and enhancement uses of gene-editing, which is something that might lead to it becoming, at some point, the nation with the most gene-edited babies.

<!-- &emsp; I believe that the current median sentiment for whether gene-editing research is a misuse has likely not strayed far from 63% median of 2020, given that I am someone who is fairly interested in gene-editing and who actively monitors research activity on it and, despite this, that I have not heard much in the mainstream news in support of or against gene-editing. Support for using gene-editing for treatment, be it for illness at birth (median 70% support) or illness over lifespan (median 60% support), is something that I also don't expect to have changed much. I believe that any change in sentiment would be in the direction of further support. -->

#### *Bioethicists' Take*

While I am not too familiar with the history of [eugenics][wiki_eug]{:target="_blank"}, my current intuition is that most researchers whose work belongs to the fields of genetics, gene-editing, CRISPR-Cas9, heritability, etc... are incentivized to dissociate themselves from the term _eugenics_ and, partly because of this, [appeal to ridicule][wiki_rid]{:target="_blank"} in their assessments of the long-term prospects of human gene-editing, at least for enhancement purposes. For treatment purposes, I think that bioethicists may be more split.

&emsp; Ever since the [He Jiankui affair][wiki_he]{:target="_blank"}, where [He Jiankui][wiki_he2]{:target="_blank"} of the [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)][wiki_so]{:target="_blank"} in [Shenzhen][wiki_shen]{:target="_blank"} used [CRISPR-Cas9][wiki_cri]{:target="_blank"} to genetically modify a set of embryos, which ultimately lead to three gene-edited babies being born, bioethicists seem to have taken, generally, a firm stance against gene-editing in humans.

&emsp; Such a stance was illustrated when, following the He Jiankui affair, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended discontinuing applications of human germline genome editing for the near-term future in their [26 July 2019 statement][who_19]{:target="_blank"}:

> The WHO expert advisory committee on governance and oversight of human genome editing convened on 18-19 March 2019.  At this meeting the Committee in an interim recommendation to the WHO Director-general stated that “it would be irresponsible at this time for anyone to proceed with clinical applications of human germline genome editing.”

More recently, the WHO's Expert Advisory Committee on Developing Global Standards for Governance and Oversight of Human Genome Editing provided an updated stance on human germline genome editing in their 2021 report [Human Genome Editing: Recommendations][who_21]{:target="_blank"}:

> Human genome editing has great potential to improve human health and medicine. Human genome editing technologies can be used on somatic cells (non-heritable); germline cells (not for reproduction) and germline cells (for reproduction). Potential benefits of human genome editing include new strategies for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of genetic disorders; new avenues to treat infertility; new ways to promote disease resistance; contribution to vaccine development and enhanced knowledge of human biology. For example, application of somatic human genome editing has already been undertaken, including in vivo editing, to address HIV, sickle-cell disease and transthyretin amyloidosis1. Germline human genome editing contributes to deepen our understanding of the role of specific genes and processes in early human development, physiology and diseases. However, there are important areas of ongoing uncertainty as to potential benefits and risks, and gaps in scientific understanding in such key domains as off target effects and long-term risks.
>
At the same time, however, somatic, germline and heritable human genome editing raise important and outstanding ethical and social issues. Challenges associated with somatic human genome editing include, for example, rogue clinics, medical travel, as well as the reporting of illegal, unregistered, unethical or unsafe research and other activities including the offer of unproven so-called therapeutic interventions. Heritable human genome editing also gives rise to great concerns as the edit might be passed to subsequent generations. Additional issues include enhancement to improve certain traits, the lack of diversity in collections of human samples and associated data, the need for equity of access to and benefit from human genome editing. There are important differences in the scale of the current challenges posed by somatic, germline and heritable human genome editing.

The [National Human Genome Research Institute][nat_gen]{:target="_blank"} (NHGRI) takes a similar stance, i.e. a stance which acknowledges that human gene-editing could improve society greatly, but which also places immense weight on considering unintended deleterious societal and biological consequences that might emerge as a result. In the NHGRI's [Eugenics timeline][eug_tim]{:target="_blank"}, they write

> Recently, groundbreaking technologies such as CRISPR-Cas9, have raised concerns about using genome editing methods to make genetic enhancements. In response, some prominent geneticists have publicly requested to stop such enhancements.
>
Eugenics remains a constant issue in society and the scientific community, and the NHGRI is committed to monitoring its presence and confronting its inaccuracies.

One might suggest that the official statements of the WHO's or NHGRI's boards fail to capture the majority sentiments of the researchers with the technical capacity to edit human genomes or of those who work adjacent to such researchers. The paper _[Attitudes of Members of Genetics Professional Societies Toward Human Gene Editing][pub_at]{:target="_blank"}_ details the results of a 2017 online survey given to those with "genetics training"; it's abstract:

> Gene-editing technologies have improved in ease, efficiency, and precision. Although discussions are occurring around acceptable uses of human gene editing, limited data exist on the views of genetics-trained individuals. In 2017, we distributed an anonymous online survey to assess the attitudes of members of genetics professional societies toward gene editing (N = 500). Virtually all respondents were supportive of somatic editing in basic- science (99.2%) and clinical (87.4%) research on nonreproductive human cells. Only 57.2% were supportive of germline-editing basic-science research; 31.9% supported the transfer of viable embryos to humans for clinical research. While most favored future therapeutic uses of somatic (96.6%) and germline (77.8%) editing, there was little support for enhancement in somatic (13.0%) or germline (8.6%) cells. This study describes attitudes toward gene editing from genetics professionals worldwide and contributes to ongoing discourse and policy guidance in this domain.

Note that this survey[^15] occurred before the He Jiankui affair. I'm unsure as to how opinions have changed since then, but believe they very likely haven't changed by much. Imagine being in the following situation: ```It's 2017. You have genetics-training and believe human gene-editing for enhancement purposes is entirely valid (the whole deal - intelligence, attractiveness, hair color, etc...). A researcher in China oversteps current ethical boundaries, producing 3 gene-edited humans and shifting the window of social acceptability of human gene-editing more towards it being perceived as "deplorable", "a misuse of science", etc... Do you stop believing human gene-editing for enhancement purposes is entirely valid?``` I don't think so; I think such an individual would simply avoid publicly advocating for human gene-editing for enhancement purposes, out of concern for funding and [social desirability][wiki_soc]{:target="_blank"}. I'm getting ahead of myself...what did those researchers believe in 2017? Well, before getting to this, what were the 500 people polled like?

_Demographics_

![](/assets/images/design_babies_p1/GenEn_AttitudesDemo_2017.png)

The opinions of interest (at least to me) are those of the 36 clinical laboratory scientists, 148 research scientists, and 17 ELSI[^16] researchers, but the paper does not partition the results by Profession, which I find unfortunate.

_Opinions on the Acceptability of Human Gene-Editing_

_Opinions on Different Uses of Human Gene-Editing_

![](/assets/images/design_babies_p1/GenEn_AttitudesOpinions2_2017.jpg)

If we take this opinion landscape to generalize well to other people with genetics-training and to not have changed very much since 2017, then it seems that the stance that people with genetics training take on human gene-editing is _slightly_ more permissive of human enhancement than . The picture is incomplete to me, as I am generalizing my fractional perspective of the WHO's and NHGRI's positions on human gene-editing to other organizations with authority over genetic-engineering research activities.
