## Dream Log

This page is a place for me to record my dreams. I typically record my dreams in text files or on my phone upon waking. It is often the case that these recordings are fraught with grammatical errors. The most egregrious grammatical errors have been fixed, but many remain. Besides grammatical repairs, nothing else about the dreams here has been tweaked. For more recent dreams, I want to try to interpret their meaning or relevancy. For example, I have noticed that certain experiences (such as seeing bamboo one day) might leak into a dream a fews days to 2 weeks or so into the future. I have done these sorts of analyses in the past, but never recorded them. I've seen dream datasets; perhaps my dreams could be added or analyzed more thoroughly at some point. Directly personally identifying information, such as my college name, is redacted.

> There are just bits and pieces of this one, but I was by my house, walking around on the middle floor. My cat came in the back door, and began to eat some food. I noticed that there were squirrels all on the floor in a perfect grid, like points in $\mathbb{R}^2$. There were nuts or feces beneath them, but I couldn't tell / can't remember. I know that at some point, there were two malicious males coming towards the house from around the corner. In my mind there was a flash of me fighting one guy, or striking premptively, and of him pulling out a long knife and me grabbing the knife to the point where my hand began to bleed. In reality, only one guy came to the house. He had a gun and I noticed him near the driveway. I felt a rush of fear for my mother, two brothers, and cat. I tried to lock all of the windows and call 911, but misdialed the number 2 times, and it was too late. The guy was nearly inside the house and I had to run off the back porch. I jumped off of the porch into the canal nearby and swam under the water. I believe the guy with the gun came out on the porch and looked for me. I eventually came back to the house from the canal, and found out that one of my brothers had been killed, but that the rest of my family hadn't been harmed. A wave of saddness and grief filled me, and I thought, in my dream, of all the things this brother means to me and the world, of all the things he could have been or done.

> The dream started off with me stealing food from this restaurant after the restaurant's manager's family had eaten dinner. I put the stolen food in celery husks and threw them at homeless people until the homeless people figured out that I was giving them food. One guy into a blue raincoat on a bike was especially appreciative. At one point, I got them rice but some woman from the restaurant pushed it on the ground, and I or someone else put her in a choke hold until she lost enough oxygen to get brain damage. In another part of the dream, I was on a little ledge between two extremely tall apartment complexes. There was some arab guy in a mechanic suit next to me with a sniper rifle and I heard in his mind that he was being commanded to kill [me]. I decided then (since he didn’t see me for some reason) to push him off the ledge and I did. I had to get in through this small window and a younger, happier version of the same guy helped me in. It turned out a mix of me, [acquaintence], and this guy became friends and after a war or something needed to kill each other. The final part involved me and my two brothers and mother on a walk. We were on these rolling white cliffs that led down to a valley. The valley had old historical houses in it and a forest. My mother kept walking straight and fell off and hit a rock jutting out and then landed onto this flat rock projection. Everyone thought she died and it would basically be a fucked job to get her if she wasn't dead. I used the reflection from my watch to shine it over her eyes and she did the same to me with her watch, which signalled to us she wasn't dead. As a joke she pretended to be tanning but mostly couldn’t move. We had been walking to the left of where I was facing but I ran right and this action convinced my brothers to follow me. It was steep going down and the cliff eventually turned into a dirt road. There were abandoned construction vehicles on it. It was now dark outside and I heard mentally that the trek down to the valley would be 6 hours. Two emergency construction site vehicles sped past me. I had a little digital map and could see [brother] as yellow and [other brother] as red. They were behind me a little and then a huge intelligent gust of wind blew them away, almost a mile away. There were thorns and brambles covering the whole road as I went downhill. Something felt off and it was too silent. I knew uranium levels were getting much higher. I went through a bramble and saw floating blue and red lights almost like deep sea creatures. There were also occasional sensations of pressure. I could now see mentally the stars and a light passing through these stars. Some alien directed me to align the stars and I did and I was suddenly able to know where [other brother] had gone. I went that way. The environment changed into this huge white-beige mansion that was built into a small cliff face in the valley (you’d still fall 1000 feet if you went out of the window) and was multiple stories tall. It was mazelike and many rooms looked the same. I can’t remember what happened before I came across [other brother]. When I found [other brother] he was babbling incoherently to himself and had a silver 1911 in his one hand and some bullets in another. He would point the pistol random places and didn’t acknowledge me. I got the pistol from him and could see that there was some maybe orange light in his eyes. He kept getting out and got better. I saw the orange glow on the floor and realized that there was some field that contained a universal guide on the zoology of the universe. It had the equations for all life and if you walked near it you could read it in your head rapidly. It wasn’t meant for human minds. I kept walking and searching and felt something was following me. At one point I saw a door slightly ajar and a massive grey wolf in it. I walked fast to another room and shut the door. I had with me a few objects that looked like colored pencils, a knife, and the pistol. The grey wolf got out through the door and attacked me. It was massive but stopped attacking me. If you were fearful of it it’d kill you but if you weren’t scared of it it’d wimper and sulk. My body in the dream was fearless but my mind was scared. I stabbed the wolf in the dream continuously and steam came off of its skin. Soon it was a human shape under the tarry wolf skin and then it turned into this alien embryo that looked like an unfolded wallet with egg sacks. It made a horrible screeching noise and leaked acid, and I shot it with the one bullet I had.

> I had this dream which began with me being on a rectangular prism-like school bus. I was a summer camp counselor and wore a raincoat. On the bus were a bunch of children and two other counselors who I cannot remember too well. I know I talked to them and what they said interested me but I don't recall the details. We stopped and got off at this block building and inside we had to teach the kids something stupid. I don't remember. Two of the kids had not been listening but had been making art. Of the two, I only remember one's art and face. The kid had a school shooter haircut and his hair was completely white. His face looked like the Home Alone kid but more Russian. He had drawn, in exquisite detail in pencil, a minecraft stripper woman sitting with her hand running through her hair. Despite the stupidity of what was drawn, the drawing was extraordinary for this kid's age. Due to the two kids' work, we changed the lesson to art. On the way back, I was sitting upfront with besides the bus driver, and I had a bucket full of muddy water that had, somewhere in it, my wallet and paperwork. I do not know why it was filled with water and mud but I tried very hard to keep it from spilling. It was raining outside and the road the bus was about to drive down looked like the same road I've gone down when I worked at [X] summer camp. The tree branches shook violently at times so the bus would occassionally stop to avoid having a tree fall on it. There was a man on a bicycle going up the hill with the upper half of a tree on his back. There was just enough space to let him pass. That is the end of this part of the dream. In the next part of the dream, I was in Germany with exchange students (I am fairly confident I know what waking experience is tied to me dreaming about German things, Yannic). I recall first being in a deli place and there being a massive dude behind the counter. They brought in a YouTube prankster and wanted him to fight the guy because of what he said. The prankster walked out but got hit a few times. (this comes from a combination of someone writing "get pranked" on atomic, me/[friend]/[friend] watching a video of similar situation). Later, I was with a whole amalgam of guys who were all extremely civil in my mind. I was the "American" and felt as though I was the director of activity, by virtue of my spontaneity, and the humor dispenser in the group. They were also mature, wearing clean and finely tuned clothes and having a more professional attitude than me. The rotation of discourse would go from them talking about their girlfriends to them talking about where to go for the evening to them inquiring my take on certain things. We got a pizza that was extremely small and I remember everyone got two slices. I got a ham slice and remember that each slice was different and that there were many diverse toppings. After the pizza, we went downstairs in what appeared to be a hotel. The hotel I was at was scary. I didn't quite understand the unease when I was in the dream. It was the sort of building that went on for infinity, that you could close a door, open it, and you'd be somewhere else; the ulimate maze of mazes. It felt empty except for us. In the empty green room, there were a ton of pool tables. The balls on the table were not numbered and were fascinating. They had crystalline structures in them and different arrangements of near complete transparent glass to make them seem as if they were that crystalline solid. Imagine a square shape made out of diamonds and that if you hit it with the pool stick, the end of the stick would hit the "invisible" transparent glass. There were a bunch of balls like this. The pool sticks we had were half the size of normal pool sticks and had a long white cap and were made of beige wood. The guys I was with dumped these small (half palm size) chalky plates onto the table. They also dumped some paper shreds and pieces of cardboard. The goal of this odd pool game was to push the material into your goal to protect it while also trying to get balls into the opposite goals. There were four goals on the squarish pool table, one at the midpoint of each edge. I remember that the game kind of just ended quickly after the scramble to fill the goals and that was it. I can recall two of the German guys. One was very tall with black hair and wore a scarf and the other was my height and seemed to be the white haired kid from the summer camp but older. Me and him were the shortest of the bunch by a large margin. The only other event here that I can recall is that we were at some bar. It was above ground level and the room was black along the edges. There was a unelevated dance floor that was a black circle and the bars were behind me and to my right. The entrance was Northwest of me. I think I just talked to one of the German guys in there. Later in the dream, I was back in America. I lived with [brother] and his friends in this group house. It had a first floor, a basement that was like the pool room experienced earlier, and a large midlevel floor. Outside, from the windows on the huge midlevel floor, which had a fireplace/chimney in the middle of the room and had various tables and couches about, there was snow. [My brother]'s friends had kind of partied the place to disarray. I wished that it was cleaner. I had a CD in a CD case in my hand and used it as a phone to call the black haired German guy. The CD got pretty hot. One of [my brother]'s friends [(girl)] gave me bread. Later I was with [my other brother] in some place in the house trying to stack wood on these shelves. One of the stacks of wood ignited and we just kept stacking more wood on it until the fire died down. There was some Lego star wars set on a shelf (I know where this image came from too) that I picked up and inspected. Finally, the dream concludes with me and my father going fossil collecting. We were driving around this area that I have never been (other area of [a brook]) but wanted to go when the car ahead of us pulled into the woods. Thinking it was [this one fossil collector]'s car (because it was [certain color] near an area where there might be fossils), we slowed when passing it and I waved twice then gave a salute. I felt weird when I realized it was just a coincidence, and that the woman in the car who looked like [this fossil collector] was just staring at me. I then saw some pictures of [this fossil collector], who had slimmed down a bit and grown a mustache. We was under [this] road bridge with his father, who was holding a child. There were other family members there and [this fossil collector] had done a great job of digging into the gravel bars and getting a good bunch of fossils for his family.
