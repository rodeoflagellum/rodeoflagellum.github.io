_What progress I have made thus far on notebook for Metaculus that revolves around the World Health Organization's (WHO) dual-use research of concern (DURC) in the life sciences and emerging technologies horizon scan report from October 2021._

## Bioregulators


> Bioregulators are biochemical compounds, such as peptides, that affect cellular processes. Research has identified a number of bioregulators and synthetic analogues that can modify life processes, including cognition, reproduction and development. Bioregulators can be used therapeutically and for diagnostic purposes. They can also be misused, and such compounds can have profound effects within minutes of exposure (23). While the potential misuses of bioregulators have been known for decades, discoveries in neuroscience and neurochemistry mean that bioregulators could be used for more targeted, hostile purposes, including damage to the central nervous system, soldier enhancement, crowd suppression and behaviour manipulation (24). Misuse of bioregulators, whether naturally occurring or synthetic, could include their dispersal or manipulation of functions in a target.


## Cloud laboratories


> Cloud laboratories are emblematic of a host ofadvanced service providers that are reducing the costs of and barriers to access to biotechnology through automation, robotics and the Internet. In 2017, a review of 1628 scientific papers found that 86-89% reported one or more methods that could be conducted in a cloud laboratory (25). The potential impact of broader access to biotechnology services is far-reaching. Cloud laboratories offer important benefits, including reproducibility in synthetic biology (26) and extending access to advanced biotechnology to low- and middle-income countries.
>
> Improved access also brings issues of biosecurity. Cloud laboratories “de-skill” research by reducing some of the knowledge requirements for conducting sophisticated research protocols. Regulations lag in this area, although voluntary measures, such as in so-called “genome foundries”, have been adopted, although not universally.


## De-novo synthesis of variola virus


> Many viral agents have been successfully synthesized, including poliovirus, influenza virus and horsepox virus, an orthopoxvirus (6). Reconstruction of orthopoxviruses has raised concern about the possibility of reconstructing the variola virus (the causative agent of smallpox), which could pose a significant public health risk. The genomic sequence of the variola virus is available, and there are few technical barriers to its re-creation (27). Furthermore, other technologies are being developed that will facilitate even more rapid virus reconstruction.


## Research on SARS-CoV-2


> Research on novel infectious pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 requires careful attention to biosafety and biosecurity. The expert group expected that there will be significant research into the determinants of the infectivity, severity and host specificity of SARS-CoV-2 within the next 5 years, as well as of its immune evasion strategies. An influx of funding for research on gain-of-function to elucidate such mechanisms may facilitate the development of better countermeasures to the virus but also the discovery of more virulent strains. The availability of such strains risks both accidental release and hostile use. The tremendous health, social and economic disruptions occasioned by COVID-19 have already led to calls to rethink gain-of-function research (30).


## Synthetic genomics platforms


> Recent yeast-based synthetic genomics platforms are facilitating rapid reconstruction of both large viruses and bacteria from genomic fragments found in isolation or produced elsewhere. In 2020, SARS-CoV-2 was reconstructed by this technique within 1 week (31). In earlier studies with a similar approach, transformation-associated recombination, an infectious clone of herpes simplex virus type 1 was reassembled by in-vivo recombination of DNA fragments in yeast (32). One significant advantage of the methods is that larger DNA and RNA segments can be used than was previously possible.
>
> These new platforms could accelerate the development of therapeutics and vaccines and also rapidly increase understanding of genomic function. They might also allow recombination and selection of traits and wider access to potent pathogens. With rapid reconstruction of SARS-Cov-2 as proof of concept, researchers have highlighted the biosecurity implications of this technology (33).


## Deep learning for novel biological construct identification


> Deep-learning algorithms have a range of applications in biology and medicine, from genomic mining to identification of new treatments and pharmaceuticals (34). When such deep-learning applications are extended to complex biological molecules, they are expected to increase the identification and development of new biologically active constructs with novel functions. There are many ways in which deep learning could help in finding and creating novel compounds, from library and dataset mining (for example, from genetic libraries) to predicting gene functions (35) and molecular functions (including for antibiotics) (36).
>
> These techniques could also be used to produce novel biologicals with properties that are not found in nature, to create toxins unrelated to any known types or to create pathogens with unique pathological properties. Conversely, these techniques could support forensic investigations of biological events (37). In early studies, neural nets were used to identify the laboratory of origin of engineered DNA. Although their accuracy was initially low (38), it has since improved markedly (39).


## Extreme high-throughput discovery systems


> Extreme high-throughput screening systems allow screening of large sets of chemical, genetic or pharmacological compounds. These systems are not new, but they are becoming more modularized and accessible. In the near future, high-throughput screening could improve drug screening and the development of biological agents with greater stability, resistance to environmental stress and host range. Computational approaches have been combined with high-throughput systems and used for repurposing drugs for novel therapy (40).
>
> Pathogenicity and transmissibility remain too complex to be identified with these systems in the foreseeable future. Structures that could potentially be misused cannot be listed a priori, indicating a potential challenge for implementation and enforcement of control regimes


## Gain-of-function experiments in vectors


> Vector-borne diseases impose a substantial burden on a large portion of the world’s population (41). Research into vectors, especially arthropods, could help to control these diseases. Aspects that are under-studied include their life cycle, trans-ovarial (intergenerational) transmission and viral replication. Manipulation of vectors might reduce risks from vector-borne diseases. Already, gene drives have been used to control vector populations, and other population-level alterations are conceivable (42, 43).
>
> Knowledge on vector modification could also be misused. Insect vectors have been used in the past to deliberately spread disease, generally crudely and inefficiently. However, research on vector physiology, including the immunological (44) and autophagic responses to infection, could potentially be misused to make vector-borne diseases more dangerous. This area has received scant attention in DURC policy discussions, although it is covered by regulatory frameworks (45).


## Compound delivery on stabilized biological and toxin particles


> Novel, sophisticated ways are emerging for reliably stabilizing proteins and other biological particles. Research indicates, for instance, that tetanus antigens encapsulated in silica retain their immunogenicity (46). Proteinaceous compounds have been thermo-stabilized by cyclizing (47) and are already being used for scaffolding biopharmaceuticals (48). Encapsulation of mRNA in lipid nanoparticles has allowed stable, targeted delivery of small molecules, including, most recently, in COVID-19 vaccines (49), and can be done on an industrial scale. Encapsulation and stabilizing techniques also aid in the delivery of pharmaceuticals, including vaccines, by lessening or eliminating cold-chain requirements, which would be particularly beneficial for low- and middle-income countries. Unfortunately, stabilization technologies and techniques could also be applied to biological weapons. Environmental effects and the stability of agents have been limiting factors in many biological weapons programmes (50). New approaches to stabilizing agents could make them more resistant to environmental degradation and therefore more resilient and useful for hostile deployment.


## Targeted gene drive applications


> Research and application of gene drives are still significantly uncertain in terms of “off-target” and “knock-on” ecological effects. Apart from its inadvertent effects, this technology could be used for various hostile purposes, from agricultural sabotage and entomological warfare to ecocide. For instance, use of gene drives in agriculture could allow widespread manipulation of crop pests (51). Such research could be misappropriated to deliver hostile biological agents to agricultural systems (52) or have implications for vector-borne diseases, as discussed above.


## Hostile exploitation of neurobiology


> Research in neurochemistry, neurobiology and neuroscience is vital to finding treatments for various neurological, neurodegenerative and mental and psychiatric disorders. This area has attracted considerable funding, particularly during the past decade (53). Large research frameworks such as the European Union-funded Human Brain Project and the US National Institutes of Health Brain Initiative are examples. New insights into human neurology could, however, also be the basis for problematic applications (54).
>
> Of particular concern is neuroscientific research into assessing or modifying human thought, emotions and actions and means to affect the nervous system and alter cognitive states, behaviour and functions for performance enhancement and degradation (55). This broad topic overlaps substantially with other issues raised in this horizon scan. For instance, nano-technological delivery could erode one of the main barriers to the use of agents that act on the central nervous system (56). Similarly, understanding of the neurological function of bioregulators could provide another means of exploiting neurological advances for hostile purposes.
>
> Development of chemicals that act on the central nervous system has also raised concern, as evidenced by the fact that aerosolized chemical agents that attack the central nervous system are not permitted for law enforcement purposes under the Chemical Weapons Convention (57).


## Nanotechnology and nanoparticle toxicity


> Nanotechnology covers a wide range of technologies with an equally wide range of applications in many industries. Dual-use concern includes their application in drug conjugation and encapsulation, as well as direct targeting and specific drug release. These advances have clear health benefits, as they improve the delivery and targeting of drugs (58). Several applications that benefit from nanoscale properties are already in use, such as targeted delivery of pharmacologically active compounds (56) and intranasal delivery of biologicals that act on the central nervous system (59).
>
> There are, however, risks of both accidental and deliberate harm. Evidence suggests that nanoparticles can have neurotoxic effects (60) and that nanomaterials can bio-accumulate and pose risks as environmental pollutants. In addition, nanotechnology has direct application in both defensive and offensive military technology (56).
