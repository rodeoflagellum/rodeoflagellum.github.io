__Disclaimer__: The present status of this page is "Notes", which means that I am still figuring out how I want to present and organize the information, and am still heavily editing the content.

## [Ratings](#rating)
_This section exists as a place to accumulate and refine scoring metrics for content that I have read_

I make use of Leech's informal _[Book Durability][book_durc]_ scale, but extend it to all written work I read.

>  I approximate a book's value by guessing how often I'll reread it. This rewards dense books, sure, but also ones with broad and complex messages, durability, appeal to people of different ages, and also just the pleasure and beauty of them. I think most books are not worth the time and a small number (< 8% in a highly selected sample) are worth more than one reading.
- 1/5: Not worth one reading.
- 2/5: One read maybe, if you're into the topic.
- 3/5: Worth one skim.
- 3*/5: Great fun, one read. 'Mind candy'.
- 4/5: Very good. but one read will do.
- 5?/5: Amazing. Will reread.
- 5/5: Have reread and expect to do so indefinitely. A companion.
