__January 15 2022__

> There are just bits and pieces of this one, but I was by my house, walking around on the middle floor. My cat came in the back door, and began to eat some food. I noticed that there were squirrels all on the floor in a perfect grid, like points in $\mathbb{R}^2$. There were nuts or feces beneath them, but I couldn't tell / can't remember. I know that at some point, there were two malicious males coming towards the house from around the corner. In my mind there was a flash of me fighting one guy, or striking premptively, and of him pulling out a long knife and me grabbing the knife to the point where my hand began to bleed. In reality, only one guy came to the house. He had a gun and I noticed him near the driveway. I felt a rush of fear for my mother, two brothers, and cat. I tried to lock all of the windows and call 911, but misdialed the number 2 times, and it was too late. The guy was nearly inside the house and I had to run off the back porch. I jumped off of the porch into the canal nearby and swam under the water. I believe the guy with the gun came out on the porch and looked for me. I eventually came back to the house from the canal, and found out that one of my brothers had been killed, but that the rest of my family hadn't been harmed. A wave of saddness and grief filled me, and I thought, in my dream, of all the things this brother means to me and the world, of all the things he could have been or done.
