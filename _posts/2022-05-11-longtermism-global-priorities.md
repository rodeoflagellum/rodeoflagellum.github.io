__Disclaimer__: I want to improve the long-term future, and believe that these courses on global priorities and longtermism will help me with this. Below are the notes I've taken / am taking on many essays concerning longtermism and global priorities. I try to red-team, ask new questions, and distill as much as I can; my effectiveness with these things needs some improvement, but at a minimum, you and my future self might find some of this commentary useful. Given that these courses all cover longtermism, global priorities, and existential risk, there is some overlap - I cover the essays in the order they're listed, and don't include repeats, so this notes page is not fully representative of courses (save for the first one) in isolation.
