## 1 Introduction

###  What is this?

After reading about [Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/Links)'s personality, philosophy/morals, and political leanings, I encountered [YourMorals.org](https://yourmorals.org/), which welcomes newcomers with the following message[^1]:

> Welcome to YourMorals.org, where you can learn about your own morality, ethics, and/or values, moral values, ethical behaviors, personality, and political preferences while also contributing to scientific research. We are a group of professors, researchers, and graduate students in social psychology.

This site contains the following surveys:

In this post, I present each survey (pulling information from YourMorals.org, but not going into depth on their history, epistemics, and futures) and record my [internal monologue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_monologue)[^2] for all questions.

&emsp; _My intentions_: I want[^3] to take each survey 3 times. There are 31 surveys, and I want to take them in batches of 6 at a time (except for the last batch, which will contain 7). I want to separate the batches by 2 days. For example, I would take the first 6 around noontime on day 1, and then take the next 6 around noontime on day 3, and so on. Once I complete one cycle of the 31 surveys, I will wait at least 1 week before beginning anew. The order of the surveys I will take is the order that they are listed in the previous table.

&emsp; Note that I have already take 4 surveys [Big 5 Personality Scale, Moral Foundations Questionnaire-2 (MFQ-2), Moral Foundations Questionnaire (old version), Activities Survey] once. I looked at my results for each of these surveys for less than 5 minutes, and can't recall particular questions on any of them. I have deleted my account and data, so I am now able to retake the surveys. On the Activities Survey, I was unable to get a results report generated. Presumably, the team at YourMorals.org has not yet developed it. I expect there to be similar situations. To solve this, along with the problem of not being able to retake any survey, I will register for a new account after each survey cycle (there is, post-registration, a short demographics survey; for each survey cycle, I will not alter my demographic information). So, altogether, a design for this task might look like this:
<!--

###  Why do this?

I would like to learn about my personality, and about how these psychological surveys classify me relative to other people. I believe this exercise will be an interesting way to  experience modern psychological studies; I would like to read research employing the same surveys and reflect on what the other participants must have thought when they answered the questions.

&emsp; With regard to the survey questions themselves, I want to see how my responses in a given survey fluctuate over repeated participations. I want to get a sense of how stable my results are. I want also to capture the rapid judgements that become mentally available when I answer each question, and to see how these change.

&emsp; I believe this task does not cost me much time, and, given my interest in psychology, brains, and measurement, is entertaining (I am answering questions about _myself_!), and might afford me some insights on research in the field, on my behavior, and on my interactions with other people who fall into the same distribution of people who took the survey.

&emsp; As for my design of this task, there is probably much I am missing. Six surveys a day is to reasonably ensure that this is not dragged out for too long, and that I am not "psychologically drained" (maybe [emotionally exhausted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_exhaustion)?) from taking too many surveys (perhaps 6 is already too much). At least ten minutes between surveys each day is to reasonably ensure that, in the case two surveys have similar questions, the influence of the earlier survey on my answers in the proceeding survey will be lessened. The time interval 11:00am to 5:00pm is when I subjectively feel "most me" or "most awake". The minimum interval of one week between surveys is to give me enough time to forget about and recover from the previous week's surveys. Recording the start and end time of each survey is information that I think might end up being useful at some point.  

## Surveys

###  Moral Foundations Questionnaire-2 (MFQ-2)

|Question|Response|Internal Monologue|
|:---|:---|:---|
|||"Yes, generally speaking."|
|||"It does pain me, depends on the situation though."|
|||"No, not really. Same minimum, yes, but after that some people are better than others."|
|||"Yes, this is frustrating. Resources wasted."|
|||"Generally speaking, yes. Of course, disabled, etc..."|
|||"I want my children to be obedient, but also to point out when I am wrong."|
|||"Not really. Hopefully there will be enough aggressive people to volunteer. Sometimes it could make a difference though if everyone volunteers."|
|||"No, but again, depends. If this is UBI and everything is automated, that might be characteristic of a fewer-problem-society."|
|||"I feel bad for them, but don't feel tremendous emotional pain."|
|||"Depends on how much care."|
|||"Tough to say what this means. I think broadcasting positive actions is generally good."|
|||"Not really, unless this no loyalty sentiment induces instability civilizationally."|
|||"Sometimes yes, sometimes I don't think it's too bad."|
|||"Sometimes yes, but most people including elders, seem decently stupid."|
|||"No, not really. They should be taught about their country, and weight how good it is, but blind loyalty to it is probably off the mark."|
|||"I don't care, but it does inform my perception of them."|
|||"I kind of agree. I believe I am more inclined to like a partner if they were chaste (not completely chaste)."|
|||"No, effectiveness should be optimized for - correlation between effectiveness and effort?"|
|||"Depends on the traditional values. Presently, I would say that the traditional values are poor, so no, they should not cherish them, but generally, it might be a good heuristic if the traditions are good."|
|||"No, really disagree. Little progresses if there is always an appeal to authority."|
|||"Depends on what is meant by strong. Also, leader vs. leader(s). One person as a leader is probably not enough."|
|||"Depends on the society, but generally there are reasons why some people should have more or less than others."|
|||"I would change that to 'some traditions can serve', so unchanged, not really."|
|||"What is meant by strength? I agree that when people don't have to question loyalty in a sports team, the sport team might be more fluid."|
|||"No, some people should not feed their community or make it grow. There are bad communities."|
|||"Not necessarily - some people comfort others better. In my case, my comforting usually produces negative outcomes."|
|||"People should use what works."|
|||"Okay, seems harmless as put."|
|||"I think chastity is good, but not at this dosage."|
|||"Don't care."|
|||"Again, more effect not necessarily the same as more effective, but if we are talking about equal effectiveness, then yes someone should be rewarded more."|
|||"Again, depends on the world. If you took this world, and gave everyone the same amount of money, I don't think it would be a better place."|
|||"After some minimum threshold, the outcomes should be not be share equally."|
|||"Those who are effective should have their effectiveness sustained. Also, what is a fair society?"|
|||"No, there is nothing sacred about it."|
|||"I think an incompassionate world would be a poor one."|

- Feelings: I felt inclined to offer longer explanations the more I kept writing. I also found that, after experiencing the initial response to the question mentally, I often tried to poke holes in my justifications. I felt many of the questions had vague terms that made it difficult to decide which option to choose.

###  Big 5 Personality Scale

|Question|Response|Internal Monologue|
|:---|:---|:---|
|||"I talk a lot but not too much."|
|||"There are usually some holes in my work."|
|||"I am the enthusiasm generator in my friend group."|
|||"I feel I do this all days."|
|||"Friends and family members have perceived me as callous on some occasions."|
|||"I am easygoing, typically, but can form harsh but inconsequential judgements of others."|
|||"I hope so and try to, but probably miss the mark often."|
|||"Extremely."|
|||"Sometimes, but the task may also be a bottomless pit. I'd say strong neutral."|
|||"I do get anxious often, usually with work."|
|||"I usually fail to cope with the stress well (don't sleep, exercise, etc...)"|
|||"I hope so, and think so. My Metaculus questions, notes, and posts lend me credence."|
|||"If I am not with people, I will usually not reach out to them. I can, and sometimes do, go without talking in social situations. I am pretty shy in many ways."|
|||"See last thought."|
|||"Desk and home area are usually a mess, but not a terrible mess. I have occassions of strong cleansing."|
|||"I spend a lot of time solve problems, but I don't know if this falls into the category of inventive; I would say, generally, yes."|
|||"I am sometimes rude to others but, most often, I am not."|
|||"I usually freeze up in tense situations, but am not that calm. I don't react strongly to things."|
|||"Yeah, I do worry a lot."|
|||"I think I forgive people too readily. Most negative past interactions don't seem to weigh in much on my future interactions. "|
|||"My mood fluctuates, but not enough for me to describe it as 'moody'"|
|||"I hope so. I think others would describe me this way. Putting Agree in the case that I am wrong with Agree Strongly."|
|||"Yes, but not all of the time. I don't usually get angry or snap at people, but I sometimes don't support them emotionally."|
|||"I don't react too strongly to things. I don't know if it is emotionally stable or some mental malfunction though."|
|||"I feel that, generally, I have a low metabolism. I do have energy when talking about the things that interest me though, usually more energy than many other people I have seen."|
|||"I can get very down, but when I am with my partner, I near really get too sad. It is a fine line though."|
|||"I never feel that I am actually focusing on something."|
|||"I will try to network with people sometimes, but it usually takes me awhile to recharge this ability."|
|||"Reliability is not gurenteed."|
|||"I am pretty lazy, at least in the eyes of my family members. There is a lot of psychomotor retardation."|
|||"I hope so, but think so, generally. It goes many places."|
|||"I make plans, so +1, but I don't always follow through with them."|
|||"I used to more, but now I am more neutral to this. I still value creativity and expression decently so."|
|||"Yes, with emphasis on inhibited."|
|||"My activities are more usually separate from these fields directly, except maybe art."|
|||"Too trusting I would say, but I have been working on this."|
|||"NST, TSP art, collages, etc..."|
|||"Family usually describes me as selfish, and I wouldn't say they are that incorrect, but I am generally helpful."|
|||"I am domineering in some manners, but in most I am more flexible and adaptive."|
|||"Indirectly, I'd say, but overall I don't go out and begin an argument."|
|||"I love cooperation."|
|||"Yes, I easily forget about most others' wants and desires."|
|||"I do enjoy routines."|
|||"I can be tense, rigid, unmoving, etc... in certain situations."|

#### *Status*

"Working Draft": I don't believe I will make many more edits to the content of this page in the coming years. I will likely only alter the web-components of this page (e.g., collecting all URLs on the page to generate a link bibliography). Outside of alterations, what I have stands as a working attempt to forecast how many gene-edited humans there will be by the years 2029, 2049, and 2100.

#### *Footnotes*

[^1]: The YourMorals.org's welcome description and list of available surveys I included in this post I checked on 24 February 2022. Any changes on the site after this date I have not accounted for.

[^2]: What typically comes to mind when I think about my "internal monologue" in the context of answering survey questions are the rather quick judgements or remembrances that bring me to choose one answer over the other.

[^3]: This writing was done primarily on 24 February 2022; I will offer a retrospective update when I am finished.
