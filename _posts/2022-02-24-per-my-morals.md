_My recorded inner monologue on some psychological surveys, and some efforts to see how my responses to these surveys changes over time._



## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 What is this?

After reading about [Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/Links)'s personality, philosophy/morals, and political leanings, I encountered [YourMorals.org](https://yourmorals.org/), which welcomes newcomers with the following message<sup>2</sup>:

> Welcome to YourMorals.org, where you can learn about your own morality, ethics, and/or values, moral values, ethical behaviors, personality, and political preferences while also contributing to scientific research. We are a group of professors, researchers, and graduate students in social psychology.

This site contains the following surveys:

In this post, I present each survey (pulling information from YourMorals.org, but not going into depth on their history, epistemics, and futures) and record my [internal monologue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_monologue)<sup>3</sup> for all questions.

&emsp; _My intentions_: I want<sup>4</sup> to take each survey 3 times. There are 31 surveys, and I want to take them in batches of 6 at a time (except for the last batch, which will contain 7). I want to separate the batches by 2 days. For example, I would take the first 6 around noontime on day 1, and then take the next 6 around noontime on day 3, and so on. Once I complete one cycle of the 31 surveys, I will wait at least 1 week before beginning anew. The order of the surveys I will take is the order that they are listed in the previous table.

&emsp; Note that I have already take 4 surveys [Big 5 Personality Scale, Moral Foundations Questionnaire-2 (MFQ-2), Moral Foundations Questionnaire (old version), Activities Survey] once. I looked at my results for each of these surveys for less than 5 minutes, and can't recall particular questions on any of them. I have deleted my account and data, so I am now able to retake the surveys. On the Activities Survey, I was unable to get a results report generated. Presumably, the team at YourMorals.org has not yet developed it. I expect there to be similar situations. To solve this, along with the problem of not being able to retake any survey, I will register for a new account after each survey cycle (there is, post-registration, a short demographics survey; for each survey cycle, I will not alter my demographic information). So, altogether, a design for this task might look like this:

- take [Moral Foundations Questionnaire-2 (MFQ-2), Big 5 Personality Scale, Activities Survey, Self and Others Scale, Systems & Feelings Survey, Belief in a Just World Scale] on __25 February 2022__ between 11:00am and 5:00pm EST, with at least 10 minutes separating each survey, and recording the time I started and finished each survey.
- then [Need for Cognition Scale, Disgust Scale, Free Will Scale, Interpersonal Reactivity Index, Satisfaction with Life Scale, Levenson Psychopathy Scale] on __27 February 2022__ between 11:00am and 5:00pm EST, with at least 10 minutes separating each survey, and recording the time I started and finished each survey.
- then [Relationship Survey, Sacredness Survey, Social Dominance Orientation Scale, Cognitive Style Measure, The RWA scale, Moral Foundations Questionnaire (old version)] on __1 March 2022__ between 11:00am and 5:00pm EST, with at least 10 minutes separating each survey, and recording the time I started and finished each survey.
- then [Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale, Identity Scale, Beauty Scale, Schwartz Values Scale, Balanced Inventory of Responding, Dispositional Positive Emotion Scale] on __3 March 2022__ between 11:00am and 5:00pm EST, with at least 10 minutes separating each survey, and recording the time I started and finished each survey.
- then [Intellectual Humility Measure and Vignettes, Moral Identity Scale, Ethics Position Questionnaire, Need for Closure Scale, Behavioral Inhibition and Attraction Scales, Identification with Humanity Scale, Media Diet Survey] on __5 March 2022__ between 11:00am and 5:00pm EST, with at least 10 minutes separating each survey, and recording the time I started and finished each survey.
- register a new account on 5 March 2022 using rodeo.flagellumV2@gmail.com, filling out the same information for the demographics survey as I did previously.
- take [Moral Foundations Questionnaire-2 (MFQ-2), Big 5 Personality Scale, Activities Survey, Self and Others Scale, Systems & Feelings Survey, Belief in a Just World Scale] on __12 March 2022__ between 11:00am and 5:00pm EST, with at least 10 minutes separating each survey, and recording the time I started and finished each survey.
- then [Need for Cognition Scale, Disgust Scale, Free Will Scale, Interpersonal Reactivity Index, Satisfaction with Life Scale, Levenson Psychopathy Scale] on __14 March 2022__ between 11:00am and 5:00pm EST, with at least 10 minutes separating each survey, and recording the time I started and finished each survey.
- then [Relationship Survey, Sacredness Survey, Social Dominance Orientation Scale, Cognitive Style Measure, The RWA scale, Moral Foundations Questionnaire (old version)] on __16 March 2022__ between 11:00am and 5:00pm EST, with at least 10 minutes separating each survey, and recording the time I started and finished each survey.
- then [Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale, Identity Scale, Beauty Scale, Schwartz Values Scale, Balanced Inventory of Responding, Dispositional Positive Emotion Scale] on __18 March 2022__ between 11:00am and 5:00pm EST, with at least 10 minutes separating each survey, and recording the time I started and finished each survey.
- then [Intellectual Humility Measure and Vignettes, Moral Identity Scale, Ethics Position Questionnaire, Need for Closure Scale, Behavioral Inhibition and Attraction Scales, Identification with Humanity Scale, Media Diet Survey] on __20 March 2022__ between 11:00am and 5:00pm EST, with at least 10 minutes separating each survey, and recording the time I started and finished each survey.
- register a new account on 20 March 2022 using rodeo.flagellumV3@gmail.com, filling out the same information for the demographics survey as I did previously.
- take [Moral Foundations Questionnaire-2 (MFQ-2), Big 5 Personality Scale, Activities Survey, Self and Others Scale, Systems & Feelings Survey, Belief in a Just World Scale] on __27 March 2022__ between 11:00am and 5:00pm EST, with at least 10 minutes separating each survey, and recording the time I started and finished each survey.
- then [Need for Cognition Scale, Disgust Scale, Free Will Scale, Interpersonal Reactivity Index, Satisfaction with Life Scale, Levenson Psychopathy Scale] on __29 March 2022__ between 11:00am and 5:00pm EST, with at least 10 minutes separating each survey, and recording the time I started and finished each survey.
- then [Relationship Survey, Sacredness Survey, Social Dominance Orientation Scale, Cognitive Style Measure, The RWA scale, Moral Foundations Questionnaire (old version)] on __31 March 2022__ between 11:00am and 5:00pm EST, with at least 10 minutes separating each survey, and recording the time I started and finished each survey.
- then [Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale, Identity Scale, Beauty Scale, Schwartz Values Scale, Balanced Inventory of Responding, Dispositional Positive Emotion Scale] on __2 April 2022__ between 11:00am and 5:00pm EST, with at least 10 minutes separating each survey, and recording the time I started and finished each survey.
- then [Intellectual Humility Measure and Vignettes, Moral Identity Scale, Ethics Position Questionnaire, Need for Closure Scale, Behavioral Inhibition and Attraction Scales, Identification with Humanity Scale, Media Diet Survey] on __4 April 2022__ between 11:00am and 5:00pm EST, with at least 10 minutes separating each survey, and recording the time I started and finished each survey.

### 1.2 Why do this?

I would like to learn about my personality, and about how these psychological surveys classify me relative to other people. I believe this exercise will be an interesting way to  experience modern psychological studies; I would like to read research employing the same surveys and reflect on what the other participants must have thought when they answered the questions.

&emsp; With regard to the survey questions themselves, I want to see how my responses in a given survey fluctuate over repeated participations. I want to get a sense of how stable my results are. I want also to capture the rapid judgements that become mentally available when I answer each question, and to see how these change.

&emsp; I believe this task does not cost me much time, and, given my interest in psychology, brains, and measurement, is entertaining (I am answering questions about _myself_!), and might afford me some insights on research in the field, on my behavior, and on my interactions with other people who fall into the same distribution of people who took the survey.

&emsp; As for my design of this task, there is probably much I am missing. Six surveys a day is to reasonably ensure that this is not dragged out for too long, and that I am not "psychologically drained" (maybe [emotionally exhausted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_exhaustion)?) from taking too many surveys (perhaps 6 is already too much). At least ten minutes between surveys each day is to reasonably ensure that, in the case two surveys have similar questions, the influence of the earlier survey on my answers in the proceeding survey will be lessened. The time interval 11:00am to 5:00pm is when I subjectively feel "most me" or "most awake". The minimum interval of one week between surveys is to give me enough time to forget about and recover from the previous week's surveys. Recording the start and end time of each survey is information that I think might end up being useful at some point.

2. The YourMorals.org's welcome description and list of available surveys I included in this post I checked on 24 February 2022. Any changes on the site after this date I have not accounted for.

3. What typically comes to mind when I think about my "internal monologue" in the context of answering survey questions are the rather quick judgements or remembrances that bring me to choose one answer over the other.

4. This writing was done primarily on 24 February 2022; I will offer a retrospective update when I am finished.
