desc: "A collection of resources and updates on the Russo-Ukrainian conflict, including my personal takes and forecasts; the term \"artless\" is employed in this post's title since my interest in this conflict is recent (which means that I am still rapidly trying to catch up on the history of the subject) and my perspectives lack important cultural context (I've never been to Ukraine, have never spoken to a sample of Ukrainians, have no connections to the politicians involved, and my takes on the subject are only informed by what I've read or seen on the Internet)"
