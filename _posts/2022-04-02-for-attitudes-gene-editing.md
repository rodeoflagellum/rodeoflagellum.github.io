__Takeaways__:

- The major distinctions in human genome editing are between:
  -  Treatment vs. Enhancement
  - Somatic vs. Germline
  - Prenatal vs. Postnatal
- People without training in genetics generally don't support research on human gene-editing
- Of the people without training in genetics who support research on human gene-editing, most favor gene-editing for treatment over gene-editing for enhancement

__General Transparency__ (see footnotes):

  - _What are my biases?_[^biases]
  - _How have you atoned for these biases?_[^atonment]
  - _Shortcuts?_[^shortcuts]

  - _Actual Contribution?_[^contribution]

[^expertise]: I have no formal training in genetics.  I have a B.A. in Neuroscience and Mathematics. I've published 1 research paper. As for forecasting expertise, I am currently rank 61 on Metaculus, with an average Brier score of 0.061 (155 questions). My underconfidence is 26%. Subjectively speaking, I believe that I am slightly above average at making and updating forecasts. More about me can be found [here][about_me].

[^biases]: I am a human - [cognitive biases][wiki_biases] apply accordingly; With regard to human gene-editing, my current belief is that it's expected value is positive, in the long-term. I am optimistic about the average future involving human gene-editing for both treatment and enhancement purposes. Here is an attempt at defining my priors[^priors] and at updating my beliefs[^updates].

[^atonment]: In this essay, I do not discuss what humanity "should do" with gene-editing, and I have attempted to control for my optimism in my forecasts on people's attitudes towards human gene-editing.

[^shortcuts]: I operate within the results produced by my initial searches, and haven't considered what fraction of the research landscape I am covering, which means I'm not sure how much I am missing. I did not spend much time learning about gene-editing before writing this, and I did not completely read all the relevant research I came across (I did, however, indicate the extent I engaged with each relevant piece of research). I admit my forecasting analyses are likely missing many considerations. More on my shortcuts can be found in the overview.

[^epistemic_confidence]: I would be very surprised if someone scanned the same research literature and came to a different conclusion on people's attitudes towards human gene-editing. I would not be too surprised if someone's forecasts on the questions I have written differed a fair amount from mine (+/- 20%[^forecast]), both at the time of me submitting this and in the future.

[^support]: Most of the claims in my review are supported by findings in the research articles I surveyed, and for the claims that aren't directly supported, I try to make it clear whenever I am speculating, such as when I am investigating causal drivers for some of the  research findings. I believe that my forecasting claims have less support in the sense that they are speculation about human behavior, which I do not presently know how to use the tools to understand well.

[^inadeq]: I would accuse my report of the following [inadequacies][gleech_metrics]: "Appalling prose", "Could be", and "Stating the Obvious".

[^contribution]: In this essay, I have surveyed, at different levels, X published articles on people's attitudes towards human gene-editing. I have aggregated and distilled the survey data from these articles. I've generated 12 forecasting questions related to people's future attitudes towards human gene-editing. My predictions on these questions, along with the forecasting processes I employed, are detailed below. Beyond these things, I emailed X corresponding authors and 1 other author of X published articles the following questions: _What general attitude do you think people will have towards human gene-editing in 2030, 2050, and 2075?_ and _What will be the cumulative number of genetically edited babies born by 2030, 2050, and 2075?_. I have yet to receive any responses, but when I receive at least 5, I will include them below[^referral].

__Contribution__: 

[^priors]: Before working on this essay, I want to outline my current thoughts on human gene-editing; doing this might help me better determine how people might update their beliefs after reading this essay. My current understanding of the regulations, technology, and biology of gene-editing comes predominantly from working on my _[Forecasting Designer Babies][designer-babes]_ essay. However, I still do not feel that I strongly understand gene-editing. Floating around in my mind, not well grounded, are the concepts "assisted reproductive technology", "IVF", "CRIPSR-Cas9", "germline genome editing", "somatic cell genome editing", and "treatment vs. enhancement distinction", among others. Each of these I could explain broadly, but if pressed to go deeper, I would fail. Generally speaking, I believe that most Western liberal-leaning people are cautiously optimistic about human gene-editing, that religious and/or older and/or conservative people are less likely to support gene-editing research, that most people are not familiar with what gene-editing entails, and that most people who support gene-editing favor treatment over enhancement.

## Overview and Shortcuts

<!-- > _Homo sapiens_ is a relatively young species and has not had as much time to accumulate genetic variation as have the vast majority of species on earth, most of which predate humans by enormous expanses of time. Nonetheless, there is considerable genetic variation in our species. The human genome comprises about $3 \cdot 10^9$ base pairs of DNA, and the extent of human genetic variation is such that no two humans, save identical twins, ever have been or will be genetically identical. Between any two humans, the amount of genetic variation—biochemical individuality—is about .1 percent. This means that about one base pair out of every 1,000 will be different between any two individuals. Any two (diploid) people have about $6 \cdot 10^6$ base pairs that are different, an important reason for the development of automated procedures to analyze genetic variation [See <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK20363/>] -->

Humans generally desire to be content and feel well, to live long and healthily, and to experience fulfillment. Accomplishing these ideals depends on many things, including but not limited to freedom from physical and psychological afflictions, supportive social environments, and healthy lifestyle practices. 

<!-- EDIT:
In particular, many factors that affect these requirements have genetic components. For example, people with this gene report higher life satisfaction. 
However, one relatively static factor that partially determines the quality of life are  -->

With respect to these aspirations, and to human civilization and biology generally, gene and genome editing is a technology with transformative potential. 

There are over 4600 genes in humans with phenotype-causing mutations; these genes account for over 6000 single gene disorders[^examples_single_cell] and traits, around 700 instances of increased suseptibility to complex diseases or infections, and around 250 somatic cell genetic diseases[^OMIM]. 

Among these maladies are genetic disorders such as Sickle Cell Disease, which results in a person's blood cells being mishapen, dying early, and clogging blood vessels, and can cause the person "pain and other serious problems such infection, acute chest syndrome and stroke"[^cdc_sickle_cell]. Another genetic disorder is Phenylketonuria (PKU), which affects around 1/15,000 US children, and can lead to cognitive and behavioral problems and can stunt development, among other things, if left untreated.[^pku_additional] 

<!-- FOOTNOTES============================ -->
[^examples_single_cell]: For other examples of single gene disorders, see <https://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/disorders/singlegeneeg/> and <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK132154/>. ex2_single_cell_disorders.html

[^cdc_sickle_cell]: See <https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/sicklecell/facts.html>: "_SCD is a group of inherited red blood cell disorders. Healthy red blood cells are round, and they move through small blood vessels to carry oxygen to all parts of the body. In someone who has SCD, the red blood cells become hard and sticky and look like a C-shaped farm tool called a “sickle”. The sickle cells die early, which causes a constant shortage of red blood cells. Also, when they travel through small blood vessels, they get stuck and clog the blood flow. This can cause pain and other serious problems such infection, acute chest syndrome and stroke._". Also, see cdc_sickle_cell_05272022.html. 

[^pku_additional]: For more about PKU see <https://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/disorders/singlegeneeg/>: "_Babies who have PKU are usually healthy at first, but symptoms appear within a few months. These may include slow growth, eczema (a skin rash), musty body odor (from too much Phe), small head size, and fair skin (because Phe is converted into skin pigment). Without treatment, children with PKU experience developmental delays, behavior problems, intellectual disability, and seizures._"
<!-- =====================================-->

Gene and genome editing could one day enable people to be free from these and other disorders and diseases by targeting and ameloriating[^how_gene_editing_work_broadly] the affected gene(s)[^examples_somatic_genome_fix]. To me and, as we will see, a fair number of other people, a future devoid of the suffering induced from genetic disorders seems like a GOOD thing.

[^examples_somatic_genome_fix]: For other examples of therapeutic applications of somatic cell genome editing, please refer to this table. 
<!-- =====================================-->

In addition, gene and genome editing, if further developed, could safely permit humans to enhance themselves[^more_on_enhancement] - robuster immune systems[^immune_system_malleability]; reduced suspecibility to infections and disease[^disease_suspectibility_malleability]; reduced aggression[^aggression_malleability]; reduced risk of addiction[^reduced_addiction_risk]; reduced depression[^depression_malleability] or anxiety[^anxiety_malleability]; higher life satisfaction[^life_satisfaction_malleability]; longer lifespans[^lifespan_malleability]; greater physical attractiveness[^physical_attractiveness_malleability], endurance[^endurance_malleability], strength[^strength_malleability], and dexerity[^dexerity_malleability]; increased cognitive capabilities[^IQ_enhancement] or creativity[^creativity_malleability]; or stronger ethical inclinations[^morality_malleability] - among plausibly many other things[^general_search_for_enhancement]. 

Given present uncertainties[^problem_with_twin_studies] with the genetic nature of these traits, it's difficult to predict how well or much gene or genome editing technology will be able to enhance them. There are also many ethical considerations that need to be taken in account[^ethical_considerations].

[^ethical_considerations]: NEED 
<!-- =====================================-->

This essay examines one factor - people's attitudes towards human gene-editing - that guides whether or how gene or genome editing technology is applied in humans. I investigate people's attitudes towards human gene-editing by reviewing research which includes surveys or sentiment analyses on this topic. 

Before discussing my findings on people's attitudes towards human gene-editing, I distill the present landscape of ethical discourse and research in human gene or genome editing. I recommend treating this section as a primer to gene-editing - a fraction of "what's out there" - and not as an authoritative resource on the topic. 

After discussing people's attitudes towards human gene-editing, I try to unpack what factors might best explain these attitudes. My explanations and considerations for what drives people's beliefs concerning human gene-editiing should be received with skepticism, as I believe my claims here are sparsely supported; should someone else spend. Next, I look at how people's attitudes towards human gene-editing guides the governance, rate of development, and usage of these technologies. 

Finally, I consider some questions that interest me and that I think are important to timelines and outcomes involving human gene-editing. From the list of questions I generate, I select those whose outcomes I think are somewhat dependent on changes in or those that are directly about people's attitudes towards human gene-editing to write up on Metaculus. I then predict on these questions, and outline my rationale for my forecasts. 

This is essay was written primarily with the goal of determining what people think about human gene-editing and of generating forecasting questions on this topic. All in all, I think this essay reasonably accomplishes these goals.

I did take some shortcuts in writing this essay. 

- I haven't extensively analyzed all or most of my references, which means that I have treated them as though they are likely true, even though I don't suspect this is the case (i.e., I'm not sure as to how accurate my references are, to how evidencing they are, and to what their issues are). Two examples of this are that I haven't taken into account the problems with twin studies[^twin-studies], and that I haven't taken into account the problems that occur with self-reporting[^self-reporting]. 
- I did not write down many of the search terms I used for finding my evidence and the resources I use. This makes it more difficult for others to find resources to invalidate or validate my evidence and claims. 
- I have not considered the "economics" of human gene-editing, which is something that might be an even more accurate indicator of how people will respond to human gene-editing. Economic indicators - stocks, bets, funding, etc... - for companies and organizations that investors believe might make widespread human gene-editing possible were not considered in this essay, but might add substantial support to some of the findings in this essay.

## [Prospects and Perils](#prospects-perils-gene-editing)

This section tries to offer a fractional look at the questions:

- What is gene-editing, broadly speaking?
- What is the state of research on human gene-editing?
- What benefits might human gene-editing offer to humanity?
- What concerns for humanity are there with human gene-editing?

### Gene-Editing, -Therapy, -Engineering, -Modification,...?

I expect that most people reading this ([LW][lw], [EAF][eaf], [Metaculus][metaculus] users) recognize the following terms - genetic engineering, gene-editing, genetic modification, gene therapy, genome editing - but might not know the nuances between them.

[lw]: https://www.lesswrong.com/ "https://www.lesswrong.com/"

[eaf]: https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/ "https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/"

 Thus far, I have not actually found a resource that adequately differenties these terms, but in reading about them them, I've formed the belief that they are not too different. In many instances, these terms are used interchangeably[^interchangeable]. Nevertheless, gene and genome editing are typically examples of genetic engineering and modication, and gene therapy. 

 Here are some definitions I've come across for genetic engineering, gene-editing, genetic modification, gene therapy, and genome editing. 

<!-- FOOTNOTES============================ -->
[^interchangeable]: From <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome_editing#cite_note-75>: "_Genome editing, or genome engineering, or gene editing, is a type of genetic engineering in which DNA is inserted, deleted, modified or replaced in the genome of a living organism._". <br><br> From <https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Genetic-Engineering>, "_Genetic engineering (also called genetic modification) is a process that uses laboratory-based technologies to alter the DNA makeup of an organism. This may involve changing a single base pair (A-T or C-G), deleting a region of DNA or adding a new segment of DNA._" <br><br> From <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering>, "_Genetic engineering, also called genetic modification or genetic manipulation, is the direct manipulation of an organism's genes using biotechnology. It is a set of technologies used to change the genetic makeup of cells, including the transfer of genes within and across species boundaries to produce improved or novel organisms. New DNA is obtained by either isolating and copying the genetic material of interest using recombinant DNA methods or by artificially synthesising the DNA._" <br><br> "_Genome editing, also called gene editing, is an area of research seeking to modify genes of living organisms to improve our understanding of gene function and develop ways to use it to treat genetic or acquired diseases. Genome editing can be used to correct, introduce or delete almost any DNA sequence in many different types of cells and organisms._" <https://www.nih.gov/news-events/gene-editing-digital-press-kit> <br><br> From <https://allianceforscience.cornell.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Gene-editing-FAQ_V2.pdf>, "_Gene editing is also sometimes referred to as genome editing, CRISPR, and GE and included in the broader terms of genetic engineering and biotechnology._" and "..._In this case, gene editing is used to generate GMOs._". 

[^gene_ther_genome_editing]: From[^HGE-Book] pp. 106, <br><br>"_Like traditional gene therapy, somatic genome editing could be used to revert an underlying genetic mutation to a variant not associated with disease, which would result in a fraction of the targeted cells regaining normal function. Somatic genome editing also could be used to engineer a cell so that its phenotype differed from that of a normal cell and was better able to resist or prevent disease._"
<!-- =====================================-->

<!-- My present understanding is that genetic engineering subsumes gene-editing, genome editing, genetic modification, and gene therapy, and that genome editing, gene-editing, and genetic modification are often used interchangeably, but that genome editing and gene therapy are in some instances considered specific forms of gene-editing[^gene_ther_genome_editing], sometimes with the same end in mind. In this essay, I exclusively refer to the act of altering human DNA as human gene-editing or human genome editing. -->

Gene therapy involves introducing DNA containing a functioning gene (created by genetically modified viruses) into a patient to correct the effects of a disease-causing mutation. There are two basic types of gene therapy depending on the cells targeted or treated: somatic and germline therapy. Most cells of the human body are somatic cells and transferring DNA to such (differentiated, non-reproductive) cells will just produce effects in this patient without being transmitted to the patient’s off- spring. Cells of the germline are gamete cells (undifferentiated, reproductive), eggs, and sperm and any change in them will be transmitted to the patient’s children.

> 
Gene therapy is a technique that modifies a person’s genes to treat or cure disease. Gene therapies can work by several mechanisms:
> 
- Replacing a disease-causing gene with a healthy copy of the gene
- Inactivating a disease-causing gene that is not functioning properly
- Introducing a new or modified gene into the body to help treat a disease
> 
> Gene therapy products are being studied to treat diseases including cancer, genetic diseases, and infectious diseases.
> 
> There are a variety of types of gene therapy products, including:
> 
- Plasmid DNA: Circular DNA molecules can be genetically engineered to carry therapeutic genes into human cells.
- Viral vectors: Viruses have a natural ability to deliver genetic material into cells, and therefore some gene therapy products are derived from viruses. Once viruses have been modified to remove their ability to cause infectious disease, these modified viruses can be used as vectors (vehicles) to carry therapeutic genes into human cells.
- Bacterial vectors: Bacteria can be modified to prevent them from causing infectious disease and then used as vectors (vehicles) to carry therapeutic genes into human tissues.
- Human gene editing technology: The goals of gene editing are to disrupt harmful genes or to repair mutated genes.
- Patient-derived cellular gene therapy products: Cells are removed from the patient, genetically modified (often using a viral vector) and then returned to the patient.

> [Genome editing][wiki_genome_editing] is a powerful new tool for making precise additions, deletions, and alterations to the genome an organism’s complete set of genetic material. The development of new approaches—involving the use of [meganucleases][wiki_meganuclease]; [zinc finger nucleases][wiki_zinc_fingers] (ZFNs); [transcription activator-like effector nucleases][wiki_TALENS] (TALENs); and, most recently, the [CRISPR][wiki_CRISPR]/[Cas9][wiki_cas9] system—has made editing of the genome much more precise, efficient, flexible, and less expensive relative to previous strategies. With these advances has come an explosion of interest in the possible applications of genome editing, both in conducting fundamental research and potentially in promoting human health through the treatment or prevention of disease and disability. The latter possibilities range from restoring normal function in diseased organs by editing [somatic cells][wiki_somatic_cell] to preventing genetic diseases in future children and their descendants by [editing the human germline][wiki_germ_edit].

> Human genome editing has great potential to improve human health and medicine. Human genome editing technologies can be used on somatic cells (non-heritable); germline cells (not for reproduction) and germline cells (for reproduction). Potential benefits of human genome editing include new strategies for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of genetic disorders; new avenues to treat infertility; new ways to promote disease resistance; contribution to vaccine development and enhanced knowledge of human biology. For example, application of somatic human genome editing has already been undertaken, including in vivo editing, to address HIV, sickle-cell disease and transthyretin amyloidosis1. Germline human genome editing contributes to deepen our understanding of the role of specific genes and processes in early human development, physiology and diseases. However, there are important areas of ongoing uncertainty as to potential benefits and risks, and gaps in scientific understanding in such key domains as off target effects and long-term risks.
> 
> At the same time, however, somatic, germline and heritable human genome editing raise important and outstanding ethical and social issues. Challenges associated with somatic human genome editing include, for example, rogue clinics, medical travel, as well as the reporting of illegal, unregistered, unethical or unsafe research and other activities including the offer of unproven so-called therapeutic interventions. Heritable human genome editing also gives rise to great concerns as the edit might be passed to subsequent generations. Additional issues include enhancement to improve certain traits, the lack of diversity in collections of human samples and associated data, the need for equity of access to and benefit from human genome editing. There are important differences in the scale of the current challenges posed by somatic, germline and heritable human genome editing. [See [https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240030381][who_recommendations]]

With regard to human genome editing, there are three primary distinctions, two of which are historical in nature; the last is one that I believe is neglected — in my experience, many people primarily associate "designer babies" (prenatal editing) with human genome editing, but there are in fact many postnatal applications of genome editing.

- (Treatment vs. Enhancement) Interventions
- (Somatic vs. Germline) Editing
- (Prenatal vs. Postnatal) Editing

The historical distinctions are given in[^HGE-Book]:

> In the 1970s, certain central distinctions were drawn (Juengst, 1997; Walters and Palmer, 1997). First, the distinction between somatic and germline genome modifications was established: somatic enhancements affect only a single indi- vidual, but heritable enhancements can be passed down through the generations. Discussions of heritable enhancements included concerns about possible effects on the gene pool and fears of a return to some form of eugenics. Second, a distinction was drawn between treating or preventing disease (therapy) and enhancement. Discussions of enhancement focused on issues such as safety and (especially in competitive environments such as sports) unfair advantage, with the definition of “unfair” highly dependent on context.

Major events 

<!-- https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/policy-issues/what-is-Genome-Editing
> In 2015, scientists successfully used somatic gene therapy when a one-year old in the United Kingdom named Layla received a gene editing treatment to help her fight leukemia, a type of cancer. These scientists did not use CRISPR to treat Layla, and instead used another genome editing technology called TALENs. Doctors tried many treatments before this, but none of them seemed to work, so scientists received special permission to treat Layla using gene therapy. This therapy saved Layla's life. However, treatments like the one that Layla received are still experimental because the scientific community and policymakers still have to address technical barriers and ethical concerns surrounding genome editing. -->

<!-- https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/policy-issues/what-is-Genome-Editing
Summary of ethical concerns 
Scientists and all of us should carefully consider the many ethical concerns that can emerge with genome editing, including safety. First and foremost, genome editing must be safe before it is used to treat patients. Some other ethical questions that scientists and society must consider are:

    Is it okay to use gene therapy on an embryo when it is impossible to get permission from the embryo for treatment? Is getting permission from the parents enough?
    What if gene therapies are too expensive and only wealthy people can access and afford them? That could worsen existing health inequalities between the rich and poor.
    Will some people use genome editing for traits not important for health, such as athletic ability or height? Is that okay?
    Should scientists ever be able to edit germline cells? Edits in the germline would be passed down through generations. -->

[genetic_editing_timeline]: /assets/2022/for_attitudes_gene_editing/docs/genetic_editing_timeline.html

Even without understanding the details of these developments, it's apparent, in my mind, that the science of gene-editing is progressing rapidly. A short overview can be found in the abstract of _Hirakawa et al.'s_ 2020 paper _Gene editing and CRISPR in the clinic: current and future perspectives_[^hirakawa]:

> Genome editing technologies, particularly those based on zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat DNA sequences)/Cas9 are rapidly progressing into clinical trials. [See <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7146048/pdf/bsr-40-bsr20200127.pdf>]

[^hirakawa]: Hirakawa, Matthew P., Raga Krishnakumar, Jerilyn A. Timlin, James P. Carney, and Kimberly S. Butler. "Gene editing and CRISPR in the clinic: current and future perspectives." Bioscience reports 40, no. 4 (2020).

One proxy for validating this is to observe changes in the frequency of terms such as "gene-editing" or, more interestingly, "human gene-editing" over time. Searching "gene-editing" (with the quotes) on Google Scholar (not including citations), we get the following for the years in the closed interval [2000, 2021].

![](/assets/2022/for_attitudes_gene_editing/images/gene_editing_2000-2021.png)

Note that the line indexed with (1) refers to the cumulative number of search results, the line indexed with (2) corresponds to the number of results for each year.

If it is true that search term frequency is closely correlated with research activity, then this above graph implies interest and research in gene-editing is growing tremendously. This is not too surprising given the theoretical benefits gene-editing could afford. I was more surprised to see how abruptly results "human gene-editing" grew.

![](/assets/2022/for_attitudes_gene_editing/images/human_gene_editing_2000-2021.png)

What's missing from this search is the proportion of these research results that concern the ethics surrounding, the governance of, the technology of, and people's attitudes towards human gene-editing (i.e., what is the breakdown for different types of research on human gene-editing); I do not investigate these things in this essay, but would appreciate if anyone can comment on this; my premonition is that most research is technical in nature, with the next largest group being ethics and governance, which in my experience often coincide with each other.

Beyond search term frequency, I believe looking at the number of clinical trials involving gene-editing over time would be useful and interesting.

From[^hirakawa]:

> The U.S. clinical trials database (clinicaltrials.gov) contains all studies which meet the definition of an ‘applicable clinical trial’ initiated on or after 27 September 2007 or continuing beyond 26 December 2007. In addition to trials required to register, voluntary registration is also accepted; studies conducted outside U.S.A., and those which may meet one of the conditions in the future, often register voluntarily. We searched the U.S. clinical trials database (01/01/2020) for any trial containing at least one of the following terms: CRISPR, Cas9, Cas12, Cas13, ZFN, zinc finger, gene edit, gene modification, and genome edit. Trials that did not use the genome editor as part of the therapeutic intervention were excluded from the analysis; these included trials to create cell lines from patients using Cas9; use of patient cells to develop therapeutic strategies, but where the cells were not used as a therapeutic themselves; CRISPR use for genome sequencing; and surveys of opinions regarding human gene editing. This search identified 41 trials utilizing genome editing agents including ZFNs, TALENs, and CRISPR/Cas9 for therapeutic interventions, no studies utilizing Cas12 or Cas13 have been registered (Table 1).

The number of results in _Hirakawa et al.'s_ Table 1 by year (they mention 41 trial results, but there are 50 entities in their Table; I have not resolved why this is the case, but don't think it matters too much) is in line with the Google Scholar query results on gene-editing and human gene-editing.

![](/assets/2022/for_attitudes_gene_editing/images/trials.png)

Going on <https://clinicaltrials.gov/>, and searching separately "genome editing" and "human gene editing", I get:

### [Affordances](#affordances)

Given we've now looked at what gene-editing entails, and where the state of research on it stands broadly, let's look at the potential affordances and risks of human gene-editing.

One can easily imagine the prospects of altering a human's genes; the following quotes illustrate this to some degree.



Current clinical trials involving human genome editing consist of postnatal somatic cell treatments of genetic disorders; I suspect this will continue to be the case in the near-term future, given the uncertainties with germline genome editing and with  prenatal genome editing.

So, one affordance of human gene-editing is the potential to free humanity from certain genetic disorders. Let's look at an example a genetic disorder that might be treated with genome editing. 

From Wikipedia's [page on Phenylketonuria][wiki_PKU]:

>  Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of metabolism that results in decreased metabolism of the amino acid phenylalanine. Untreated PKU can lead to intellectual disability, seizures, behavioral problems, and mental disorders. It may also result in a musty smell and lighter skin. A baby born to a mother who has poorly treated PKU may have heart problems, a small head, and low birth weight.

[wiki_PKU]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylketonuria "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylketonuria"

The [World Health Organization][who] (WHO) created, in 2019, the [Human Genome Editing][hge] (HGE) Registry, which gets it's data from the WHO's [International Clinical Trials Registry Platform][ictrp] (ICTRP). You can find the ICTRP trials that are related to human genome editing here:

As of the time of writing this (around May 23 2022), the most recently registered clinical trial _Safety and Efficacy of HMI-103, a Gene Editing Development Candidate in Adults With Classical PKU Due to PAH Deficiency_  (see [here][trial]) is aimed at aiding those with PKU.

> This is an open-label, sequential ascending dose-escalation, Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single intravenous administration of HMI-103, a gene editing development candidate, in adult participants aged 18 to 55 years, inclusive, with classical PKU due to PAH deficiency who have uncontrolled disease despite Phe-restricted dietary management. [See <https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05222178>]

[trial]: https://trialsearch.who.int/Trial2.aspx?TrialID=NCT05222178 "https://trialsearch.who.int/Trial2.aspx?TrialID=NCT05222178"

A future void of PKU would probably reduce some amount of suffering, which most people would likely consider to be a GOOD thing. 

PKU is just one of example of a genetic disorders that gene-editing can help; Wikipedia's [list of genetic disorders][wiki_list_of_disorders] claims that there are more than 6000 [genetic disorders][wiki_disorder] humans suffer from.

These discoveries include pathogenic variants in a gene that had not previously been associated with disease and pathogenic variants in a gene previ- ously associated with a different disease (Boycott et al., 2017)_"

Though fairly outdated (2017) source[^HGE-Book] provides a window into the landscape human genome editing's potential for treatment. 

![](/assets/2022/for_attitudes_gene_editing/images/hge_treat.png)

Outside of treating genetic disorders, genome editing in humans can be used to enhance traits. It's plausible that traits such as creativity, morality, kindness, intellect, physical capability, physical attractiveness, aggression, and susceptibility to addiction, among others, can be modified. 

The prospect of enhancement is intuitive: there are just so many things that humans want to improve in themselves, and genome editing for enhancement is one pathway towards this. 

I am not going to discuss human genome editing for enhancement much more, but there are numerous ethical considerations that should be taken into account when considering human genome editing for this end. 

### [Risks and Concerns](#risks-and-concerns)

Erik Hoel's _Nietzschean future_[^hoel-contention] in his post _[How to prevent the coming inhuman future][erik_hoels_inhuman_future]_ provides a vivid picture of a future involving some undesirable social consequences of human genome editing for enhancement:

[erik_hoels_inhuman_future]: https://erikhoel.substack.com/p/how-to-prevent-the-coming-inhuman?s=r "https://erikhoel.substack.com/p/how-to-prevent-the-coming-inhuman?s=r"

> The future consists of what the name implies: Übermensch. If we imagine significant genetic editing becoming widespread, we may first simply imagine designer babies, little beings who seem quite unthreatening, just robust and happy creatures with perfect teeth and beautiful eyes. So let’s grow them up and imagine them as designer people, their rich parents having selected their genes specifically for athleticism, competitiveness, IQ, and leadership, with whatever polygenetic profiles those require. They’ll look a lot like the Greek gods. They’ll get into whatever college they want, they’ll never get sick, they’ll run faster, think deeper, and they’ll fuck harder. They will be gorgeous and whip-smart. But, just like the Greek gods, they will be a bunch of petulant, racist, sociopathic superpredators, great in bed but terrible in a relationship. For the sought-after designer traits will likely be things that only give direct selfish benefits, and knowledge of their genetic superiority will likely breed arrogance and contempt.

...

> For imagine being told you’ve been chosen, forged to be objectively better than other people. In the tiniest mechanisms of your cells. Now, look out at the world of normies. What is your level of respect for them? And if your answer isn’t a sneer, that you’re looking at a bunch of Neanderthals who should be replaced, that they are pitiable at best, you don’t understand the darker aspects of psychology. Shakespeare? Why should they care what he wrote? He’s just another Neanderthal.

I imagine that most people, even without having thought extensively about the social and economic forces guiding humanity's reactions to human gene-editing or about the different ways in which gene-editing can be used on humans, would agree that the future in Hoel's vignette is undesirable.

[Vera Lucia Raposo][vera]{:target="_blank"}[^vera-point], in her paper 2019 paper _[The First Chinese Edited Babies: A Leap of Faith in Science][fir_gen]{:target="_blank"}_, provides a nice section on these potential issues with human gene-editing and her contentions with them. 

In summary, the four main axes of contention are:

- (1) sanctity of genome
- (2) genetic discrimination and eugenics
- (3) undermining human genetic pool
- (4) loss of human nature

> Ethical concerns have long been asserted against genetic interventions. However, most of the objections have been based more on prejudice than substantive arguments. Critics have invoked the sanctity of the human genome, as if changing it would equate to playing God ([Habermas, 2003][hab]{:target="_blank"}). However, protecting the human genome should not prevent genetic interventions that can improve our lives. What brings real value to our lives is having a genetic code that allows us to live free of severe diseases, not to have an unmodified but unhealthy genetic code. Some have argued the perils of genetic discrimination ([Mehlman & Botkin, 1998][meh]{:target="_blank"}) and eugenics ([Habermas, 2003][hab]{:target="_blank"}), but if that were truth no medical treatment would be allowed under the suspicion of discriminating the ones not that are not treated and of aspiring to create a “superior” society of healthy people. The risk of undermining the human genetic pool ([Committee on Science, Technology, and Law, 2016][com]{:target="_blank"}) is also a recurrent concern, but “there are more than six billion humans on the planet. Absent some kind of magic wand, it is initially difficult to see how any given genetic intervention could change human nature” ([McConnell, 2010][mcc]{:target="_blank"}). The eventual loss of our human nature (Habermas, 2003) has been also invoked, but changing our genes does not change our human nature. Humanity does not reside in a specific genetic code, but in a certain perception of the world and our role in it. That role adds to the story of how we overcome the surrounding environment and ourselves.

For those unaware, in blah blah blah. And a distinction is typically made between outlooks on the future of human genome before and after the affair. 

Jodie Rothschild's 2020 paper _Ethical considerations of gene editing and genetic selection_[^rothchild] synthesizes, in greater detail than we've seen previously, some of the major ethical concerns with human genome editing in response to the He Jiankui affair.

Summarized: 

- __Off-target effects__: Using CRISPR and other gene-editing technologies can result in mutations, deletions, or insertions in DNA that were not originally intended to occur, and that might lead to complications. 
- __Downstream modification consequences__: Given that the full function of many genes is not adequately understood, editing certain genes might help treat a person, but also might lead to complications later in life, such as a weakening of the immune system. 
- __Not all sequence variations are created equally__: The changes engendered by gene alterations should be extensively studied before embryo implantation or use in humans. 
- __Mosaicism__: "There is no way to sequence a cell's genome without destroying the cell itself; as such, it is currently impossible to rule out mosaicism in a blastocyst", where a mosaicism is "variation among cells, such that the cells are not all the same— for example, in an embryo when not all the cells are edited."[^HGE-Book] that might lead to such things as disease and tumors, and to defects in the organs. 
- __Which genes/diseases to target?__: Oftentimes, which genes to target for a disease are not known. Also, the line between disease and disability is not clear, and what constitutes an "unfair" advantage from conferred by gene-editing is nebulous. 
- __Clinical Research Ethics__: 

> 
> - First and foremost, clinical trial participants should be informed of all of the associated risks and benefits.
- [How participants are selected for a study]
- Study participants should be able to voluntarily withdraw from
the research at any point
- Ethics reviews boards, committees, and training is important

- __Socioeconomic disparities__: 
- __Stigma__:
- __Insurance__:

From another [paper][another_paper][^another-paper],

<!-- Nonetheless, it is very easy to imagine negative events of varying magnitude involving human gene-editing. For example, imagine a scenario where a couple illegally has their child's germline modified, with the good intention of eliminating a heritable disease, and the modifications get carried through to future generations without many people knowing. Such as with mutations in DNA, it might be the case that some of the edits result in unintentional and unnoticeable side effects that are only harmful in select instances. This might not appear too bad on the face of it, but the problem is that the germline edits end up being propagated through the wider human gene pool. -->


<!-- &emsp; This essay is not an introduction to gene-editing, nor does it seek to comprehensively outline the landscape of debate for or against human gene-editing, but I hope that by adding some exposure to these things, absorbing the current state of people's attitudes towards gene-editing in the following sections will be easier or more enjoyable. -->

## [Mixed Feelings](#peoples-thoughts)

<!-- While I might still be misperceiving the magnitude of the expected affordances of gene-editing relative to the expected pitfalls (both indirect and direct), or vice versa, my sense is that people believe gene-editing is not risky enough to warrant a full-scale shut down of research on it, and conversely is also not potentially beneficial enough, given the expected risks, to warrant a massive (relative to the current rate of growth) influx of capital investment and research activity. --> 

Let's now examine the following questions: 

- What do people currently think about human gene-editing?
- Why do people think what they think about human gene-editing?
- Why is what people think / will think about human gene-editing important for humanity's future?

### [Today and the Last 7 Years](#last-seven-years)

There are two main mediums through which researcher's have examined what people think about human gene-editing: surveys[footnotes] and semantic text analyses[footnotes] of posts and other media on platforms such as Twitter and Reddit. 

The surveys might span multiple countries, or just focus on one group within a single country. If the s

## [Forecasting These Attitudes](#forecast-attitudes)

Thus far, I have come across few research articles on human gene-editing that explicitly outline the social, regulatory, technological, and/or economic pathways to different scenarios across the three dimensions of gene-editing, or that actually attach probabilities to any future scenario involving gene-editing in humans. 

It is also possible (and somewhat likely) that I am missing a lot here by not having extensively explored search results such as "human gene-editing scenarios". 

Nonetheless, when considering emerging technologies, I believe generating scenarios and making forecasting on these scenarios is a neglected but useful activity. 

At a minimum, this process elicits people's attitudes towards some technological phenomenon. Forecasts also provide evidence for how plausible certain futures involving some technology are. I expect this to generalize to human genome editing. 

With regard to human genome editing, these are the questions concerning the near-term and long-future that I believe most people might want to know:


Here is a list of important and/or interesting questions concerning human gene-editing that I've generated. I've written up some of the questions from this list on Metaculus; my criteria for doing this was wehther I thought the outcome of the question seemed to strongly depend on people's attitudes towards human gene-editing. 

__More Easily Defined Questions__ 

- How many research results will there be for [TALENS, ZFNs, CRISPR] in [2025, 2030, 2035]?
- When will the [4th, 100th] gene-edited human child be born? 
- When will [China, US, any country in the European Union] legalize any form of prenatal human genome editing? 
- When will any country legalize prenatal germline genome editing in humans?
  - <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1084952122000799>
- When will the first germline genome edited child be born? 
- What will be the percentage of [EU, US, Chinese] citizens to support gene-editing for enhancement in humans? 
- Which of the following countries [China, Israel, USA, Singapore, India] will be first to legalize prenatal human genome editing? 
- In the first year after human genome editing is legalized in any country, how many other countries will legalize it? 

__Less Easily Defined Questions__

- How will attitudes of the [highly, moderately, lowly] religious towards human gene-editing change? 
- How will attitudes of [liberals, conservatives] towards human gene-editing change? 
- What percent of citizens in [China, Israel, USA, Singapore, India] will consider human gene-editing a misuse of science? 
-

<!-- https://crispr-gene-editing-regs-tracker.geneticliteracyproject.org/united-states-embryonic-germline-gene-editing/ -->

Since there is a non-trivial chance that I will be able to lead a tournament on embryo editing and selection for enhancement in the coming months, I don't choose questions from this list that would be better suited for that tournament. 

- In what country will germline genome editing in humans first be legalized?
- In what country will germline genome editing in humans first be used?
- When will germline genome editing first be used? 
- In what country will gene-editing for enhancement first be legalized?
- In what country will gene-editing for enhancement first be used?
- When will gene-editing for enhancement first be used? 
- What will people think about human gene-editing in the future?
- When will the first clinical trials of gene-editing be made accessible.

The stars next to each of these represent what I subjectively evaluate the importance of these questions to be. 

Since this is an essay on people's attitudes  human gene-editing, I will


The questions that are likely related to people's attitudes on gene-editing?

I will come back to this point, but for now, I imagine that generating considerations and scenarios for what transformative effects gene-editing humans could have on humanity is still important; part of this might involve answering or attempting to answer the following questions on human gene-editing (these apply to both treatment and enhancement):

- When will the first clinical trials involving human genome editing occur?
- How successful will the first clinical trials involving human genome editing be?
- When, if ever, will human gene-editing become widely available?
- When, if ever, will human gene-editing become widely performed?
- In what ways might gene-editing be regulated, if available and/or widely used?
- What are the failure modes for human gene-editing, and how should their severity and likelihood be evaluated?

There are many more questions I could ask here. I suspect one major factor affecting the outcomes of all these questions is people's attitudes towards human gene-editing. While it seems difficult to gauge how much sway the public, bioethicists, and genetics researchers have on how gene-editing is used, it is, at the end of it, human decision-making and the beliefs that guide those decisions that determine whether humans are gene-edited. The following questions

- What influence does the [public, bioethicists, genetics researchers] have on gene-editing research and outcomes?
- What are the public's misperceptions of gene-editing?
- What biases are present in recording the public's attitudes towards gene-editing?[^opinions]

In my mind, the main objective in investigating and forecasting people's attitudes towards human gene-editing is an attempt to understand how humanity is currently reacting to the potential of altering humans using the transformative technology of gene-editing. Should contemporaneous gene-editing practices come to be performed on humans en-masse, it seems likely that much suffering could be averted in the

## [Appendix](#appendices)

### [The Landscape](#landscape)

Before writing this report, I had to gauge the landscape of research on people's attitudes towards human gene-editing. To do this, I came up with a list of search terms that I thought might be useful. 

Despite this list, I only ended up formally searching for "human gene editing survey" on OpenAlex and for "attitudes towards human gene-editing" on Google. 

By "formally searching", I mean that for these searches, I recorded my search process (see OpenAlex Queries and Google Queries). The rest of my searches were conducted on CrossRef or included terms and chains of links that I cannot recall. 

My rationale for "formally" outlining some of my search processes is to allow others to reproduce my search results and to give them a well-defined path to finding research on people's attitudes towards human gene-editing. I imagine there are likely other benefits from me outlining my search processes. 

I began by searching for "human gene editing survey" on OpenAlex for years in the interval [2016, 2021]. 

I did not include results from the search that I thought weren't especially relevant to people's attitudes towards human gene-editing[^not-useful], but made the initial mistake of including many results that just discussed the ethics of human gene-editing, but didn't include much on people's attitudes towards human gene-editing. 

After my OpenAlex search, I searched for "attitudes towards human gene-editing" on Google and looked at the first 3 pages of results (this means clicking "More Results" 2 times) on FireFox.

[^not-useful]: e.g., the OpenAlex query <https://api.openalex.org/works?search=Human%20Gene%20Editing%20Survey&filter=publication_year:2021> produces the result "_Consumer valuation of and attitudes towards novel foods produced with new plant engineering techniques: A review_", but I did not include this.

It's worth noting that each search did not include quotation marks; this means that my searches were not for the exact phrases _human gene editing survey_ or _attitudes towards human gene-editing_ (e.g., "attitudes toward human gene-editing" means I searched [attitudes toward human gene-editing] not ["attitudes toward human gene-editing"]).

I conducted my searches during the first 15 days of May 2022. Ideally, I would search for all of the terms in the Search Terms list on all of the following platforms - Google Scholar, CrossRef, OpenAlex, and Google - but this, presently, is not something I want to do and is something that I believe is not necessary, given how what reports I've covered thus far.

There were many duplicates between searches; I tried not to list any search result twice. 

Note: In the query-lists below (OpenAlex Queries and Google Queries), the list structure is organized in the following manner: the outermost list is what I searched (a query, phrase, or a remark indicating that I forgot what I originally searched); the next sub-list contains the relevant results returned from that query or phrase; and all subsequent nested lists are the works I found from looking at the references or links of a specific result.

Research that I found outside of this "formal" search is included under "Other Research". 

In all search lists,

- (★) This search result was useful in understanding people's attitudes on human gene-editing
- (★★) The same as (★) AND I selected this result to examine more closely, found that it very useful for understanding opinions on human gene-editing, but didn't include it due to my limited energies
- (★★★) The same as (★) AND this result very useful for understanding opinions on human gene-editing in more ways or to a larger degree than a (★★) result, to the point where I decided to include it in my analysis.

In some instances, I may still reference studies or results with (★) or (★★), though I didn't spend much time investigating them. 

The "Table of Covered Research" collects the research I ended up using to update my beliefs on people's attitudes towards human gene-editing. Given my limited time, I aimed to look at around 15-20 surveys, and ended up selecting and reading . 

After collecting all the search results, I then rated them (★) after reading the abstract, (★★) after skimming the paper, and (★★★) after quickly evaluating all of the (★★) results. All PEW Research reports were exceptions in that I automatically gave them (★★★), given the insights and enjoyment I've gained from them in the past. 

Abbreviations for the quickly-chosen reasons for not including the (★) or (★★) surveys:

- N: Participants too low relative to the other studies 
- L: Too localized
- Q: The work seems low quality or not very credible 
- C: Not comprehensive enough

### [Expert Questioning](#expert-questioning)

Asking people for help or information is a relatively low-cost enterprise, so I took the time to email most of the authors whose research I included in the "Table of Covered Research". In total, I sent 24 emails on 05/15/2022 and, as of 05/19/2022, have received 0 responses. I've included the template I used, along with the responses I received.

#### *Templates*

Thank you Ryan Beck and Ege Erdil for providing some feedback on the first of these two templates. The first template was sent to 1 researcher. I revised the first template to only address the corresponding authors of the articles I listed in "Table of Covered Research". If the another author's email was present in the research document, I emailed them as well.

__Template 1__

To reduce space, and since I only used this template once, I've copied it over to a text file; see [here][template_1].

__Template 2__

> Title: Forecasting Gene-Editing - [my actual name]
>
> Dear [Author],
>
> I am writing a short literature review (informal) on attitudes people have towards human gene-editing, for both enhancement and treatment purposes, with the goal of forecasting how people's attitudes might change in the coming years. My essay will be hosted on [Metaculus.com ](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/) (a crowd forecasting platform that focuses on scientific and technological change). I am not affiliated with Metaculus, but do forecast there.
>
I recently came across your work [paper I read] in my review, and really find it useful. Given your experience with research directly involved with or adjacent to gene-editing, I am interested in hearing your thoughts on the following questions (*):
>
Q1: __What general attitude do you think people will have towards human gene-editing in 2030, 2050, and 2075?__
>
> and
>
>
Q2: __What will be the cumulative number of genetically edited babies born by 2030, 2050, and 2075?__
>
> Any thoughts on these questions from you (and your research colleagues), even brief ones, would be helpful. It would also be helpful if you specified, on a scale of 0-100, what you believe is your current level of familiarity with human gene-editing.
>
>  Once I am finished with the review, I will have a set of 5-10 forecasting questions that operationalize this area of study. If you are interested in these more formal questions on people's attitudes towards gene-editing (I would love to hear your thoughts on these as well) or in the review, I can reach out to you again when they're ready.
>
> Thank you for taking the time to read this! I really appreciate it.
>
> Kind Regards,<br>
> [My actual name]
>
> (*) An example response my look like: My familiarity: 23/100; Q1: Same trend, people are much less supportive of enhancement than treatment, until ~2050. Q2: 95% confidence intervals for 2030, 2050, and 2075, respectively: 1-25000, 100-1.5m, 10k-25m

### [Glossary and Visuals](#glossary)

__Genetic Disorder__: "A genetic disorder is a disease caused in whole or in part by a change in the DNA sequence away from the normal sequence. Genetic disorders can be caused by a mutation in one gene (monogenic disorder), by mutations in multiple genes (multifactorial inheritance disorder), by a combination of gene mutations and environmental factors, or by damage to chromosomes (changes in the number or structure of entire chromosomes, the structures that carry genes). [See <https://www.genome.gov/For-Patients-and-Families/Genetic-Disorders>][^NHGRI_GDisorder]

[^forecast]: This is a tentative estimate, and is more in line with how much I think people's opinions will differ from might. I would consider a small difference in forecasts to be around 10%, and a large one to be around 35%. What constitutes a "small" and "large" difference in forecasts probably differs somewhat between people. I would appreciate if you share your forecasts for the questions in this essay in the comments and outline your reasoning. I would also appreciate critiques of my forecasts, as I am typically underconfident.

<!-- (Get some forecasts from friends; reference Yudkowsky's attitudes essay ) -->

[^vera-point]: Raposo, Vera Lucia. "The first Chinese edited babies: a leap of faith in science." JBRA assisted reproduction 23, no. 3 (2019): 197. <br><br> Note that I recycled the list and blockquote relating to Vera's paper from my other essay _[Forecasting Designer Babies][designer-babes]_.

[^timeline]: I searched "timeline of human gene-editing" in FireFox on 05/17/2022, looked at the first page of results, and found the timeline that looked the most useful (where usefulness  = some mental function of credibility and comprehensiveness). I chose the [timeline][genetic_editing_timeline] on <https://www.synthego.com/learn/genome-engineering-history> and added links to Wikipedia pages; Synthego claims of itself: <br>"_Synthego is a genome engineering company that enables the acceleration of life science research and development in the pursuit of improved human health. <br><br> The company leverages machine learning, automation, and gene editing to build platforms for science at scale. With its foundations in engineering disciplines, the company’s platform technologies vertically integrate proprietary hardware, software, bioinformatics, chemistries, and molecular biology to advance basic research, target validation, and clinical trials. <br><br> With its technologies cited in hundreds of peer-reviewed publications and utilized by thousands of commercial and academic researchers and therapeutic drug developers, Synthego is at the forefront of innovation enabling the next generation of medicines by delivering genome editing at an unprecedented scale._"

[^updates]: Once the essay is written and submitted, I will post a brief update of my beliefs in the comments.

[^sense_of_the_field]: This statement is supported for me by my anecdotal experience that, after reading another research paper or book chapter on human genome editing, the distinctions I make and the scope of what I believe should be discussed in a purview of human genome editing, among others things, alter largely from what I had written before being exposed to the additional content.

[^referral]: If you know anyone with genetics training, I would appreciate if you asked them these questions and referred them to me.

[^DNA_book]: Rosenberg, Eugene. It's in Your DNA: From Discovery to Structure, Function and Role in Evolution, Cancer and Aging. Academic Press, 2017. <br><br> Note that I am citing this definition from Chapter 10: Genetic Engineering of this book.  

[^questions-gene-editing]: I asked these questions, as well as the one in the section on gene-editing ethics and governance, without having read much on gene-editing. Given this, the questions I ask may not be the most important considerations for the biology, technology, ethics, and governance of gene-editing. I did not go back and revise these questions after learning more about gene-editing. Any considerations for revisions would be appreciated.

[^hoel-contention]: I am inclined to be somewhat skeptical of this being a plausible future. I imagine that aggression and other emotions important to coordination and relationships could also be modified in the enhancement future Hoel outlines. Across many socio-economic and demographic strata, most people I've seen want their children to be kind. I don't think it's likely that parents wouldn't select [kindness, compassion, morality, etc...] if they were available alongside things like IQ, creativity, and competitiveness.  

[^intro-thoughts]: The extent of this introduction was guided how much I felt I needed to understand gene-editing to write this essay, and by my desire to limit the content on gene-editing relative to people's attitudes on it - bringing back up the thought "this is an essay on attitudes towards gene-editing, not gene-editing" helped with this.

[^HGE-Book]: National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. Human genome editing: science, ethics, and governance. National Academies Press, 2017. <br><br> Notes: I used this book (Chapters 3 and 4, and the Appendices) to learn about gene-editing science and regulation, and most of the content in this essay's gene-editing section and glossary section come from my reading of this text.



[^opinions]: I believe I should be thinking more about how opinions change over time, and about how people's self-reported opinions are biased. Here are some considerations (maybe a simple Google search would suffice): (1) how do people's views change, (2) opinion drift, (3) how attitudes change, (4) how opinions change, (5) how often do opinions change, (6) response bias, (7) measuring response bias, and (8) self-reported data issues.

<!-- Hello, I am a recently graduated student of Neuroscience and Mathematics from [college], and I am writing a forecasting review of people's attitudes towards human gene-editing. Part of this review is creating forecasting questions. For example, on a PEW Research Center report from 2020, 56% of Indian respondents found gene-editing an appropriate use of science, so we may ask, what % of Indian respondents will find gene-editing an appropriate use of science in 2025? My problem here is that the PEW Research Center and other organizations involved with surveying people's takes on gene-editing are not guaranteed to consistently conduct these surveys. My "ask" to NHGRI is an answer to whether the NHGRI will conduct a survey on people's attitudes towards human gene-editing in the next 10 years, and whether I can talk to a genetics-researcher about this topic (I am interested in aggregating expert opinions on these forecasting questions). Thank you for reading all of this, and I wish you the best!

Kind regards,
name -->


<!-- Gene-editing does not come up in many conversations I have, and when I do mention it, my fairly neurotypical Western friends and family react mostly with cached concern-oriented thoughts such as "If everyone was intelligent, there would be no garbage men (my grandma)" and "Isn't that eugenics?" -->

<!-- _What do people think about tampering with human genes?_
_What factors are tied to people's attitudes on gene-editing?_
_What does the future landscape of opinions look like for human gene-editing?_ -->
