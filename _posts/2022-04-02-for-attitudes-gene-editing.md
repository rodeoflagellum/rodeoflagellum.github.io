Current TODO:
[]: Check table
[]: Put (★) for valuable, put (★★) for used and valuable
[]: Finish the Gene-Editing section by quoting the database, and speculating futures
[]: Wait to create a bad germline gene-editing scenario
[]: Clarify and break down intro attitudes section
[]: Read papers, take notes, group items and figures, citations
[]: Aggregate commentary on attitudes, and make some of your own graphs on change; make some 3d pie charts
[]: Discuss the drivers and ask questions about them (make supper list)
[]: Forecasting questions
[]: Have section for agree / disagree with some examples of contentions
[]: Proof readers; Connor, Twhite, Pepe, Ege, Ryanx2, AllAmericanBreakfast, Nuno, Pablo-->

__Takeaways__:

- The major distinctions in human genome editing are between treating genetic disorders and enhancing traits (treatment vs. enhancement), between somatic cell (non-heritable) editing and germline (heritable) editing (somatic vs. germline), and between editing fetuses (greater risks of error, but larger treatment effects) and editing non-fetuses (fewer risks, but smaller treatment effects) (prenatal vs. postnatal).
- People without training in genetics generally don't support research on human gene-editing
- Of the people without training in genetics who support research on human gene-editing, most favor gene-editing for treatment over gene-editing for enhancement

__Transparency__:
  - _How much expertise do you have?_ - I have no formal training in genetics.  I have a B.A. in Neuroscience and Mathematics. I've published 1 research paper. As for forecasting expertise, I am currently rank 62 on Metaculus, with an average Brier score of 0.061 (155 questions). My underconfidence is 26%. Subjectively speaking, I believe that I am slightly above average at making and updating forecasts. More about me can be found [here][about_me].
  - _What are my biases?_ - I am human - [cognitive biases][wiki_biases] apply accordingly; With regard to human gene-editing, my current belief is that it will be GOOD. I am optimistic about the average human future involving human gene-editing for both treatment and enhancement.
  - _How have you atoned for these biases?_ - In this essay, I do not discuss what humanity "should do" with gene-editing, and I have attempted to control for my optimism in my forecasts on people's attitudes towards human gene-editing.
  - _Shortcuts?_ - I operate within the results produced by my initial searches, and haven't considered what fraction of the research landscape I am covering, which means I'm not sure how much I am missing. I did not spend much time learning about gene-editing before writing this, and I did not completely read all the relevant research I came across (I did, however, indicate the extent I engaged with each relevant piece of research). I admit my forecasting analyses are likely missing many considerations.
  - _Epistemic confidence?_ - I would be very surprised if someone scanned the same research literature and came to a different conclusion on people's attitudes towards human gene-editing. I would not be too surprised if someone's forecasts on the questions I have written differed a fair amount from mine (+/- 20%[^forecast]), both at the time of me submitting this and in the future.
  - _Type of support for my claims?_ Most of the claims in my review are supported by findings in the research articles I surveyed, and for the claims that aren't directly supported, I try to make it clear whenever I am speculating, such as when I am investigating causal drivers for some of the  research findings. I believe that my forecasting claims have less support in the sense that they are speculation about human behavior, which I do not presently know how to use the tools to understand well.
  - _Major Inadequacies?_ - I would accuse my report of the following [inadequacies][gleech_metrics]: "Appalling prose", "Could be", and "Stating the Obvious".

__Contribution__: In this essay, I have surveyed, at different levels, X published articles on people's attitudes towards human gene-editing. I have aggregated and distilled the survey data from these articles. I've generated 12 forecasting questions related to people's future attitudes towards human gene-editing. My predictions on these questions, along with the forecasting processes I employed, are detailed below. Beyond these things, I emailed X corresponding authors and 1 other author of X published articles the following questions: _What general attitude do you think people will have towards human gene-editing in 2030, 2050, and 2075?_ and _What will be the cumulative number of genetically edited babies born by 2030, 2050, and 2075?_. I have yet to receive any responses, but when I receive at least 5, I will include them below[^referral].

__Priors__[^updates]: Before working on this essay, I want to outline my current thoughts on human gene-editing; doing this might help me better determine how people might update their beliefs after reading this essay. My current understanding of the regulations, technology, and biology of gene-editing comes predominantly from working on my _[Forecasting Designer Babies][designer-babes]_ essay. However, I still do not feel that I strongly understand gene-editing. Floating around in my mind, not well grounded, are the concepts "assisted reproductive technology", "IVF", "CRIPSR-Cas9", "germline genome editing", "somatic cell genome editing", and "treatment vs. enhancement distinction", among others. Each of these I could explain broadly, but if pressed to go deeper, I would fail. Generally
