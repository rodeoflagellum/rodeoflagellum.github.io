__Takeaways__:

- People without training in genetics generally don't support research on human gene-editing
- Of the people without training in genetics who support research on human gene-editing, most favor gene-editing for treatment over gene-editing for enhancement

__Transparency__:
  - _How much expertise do you have?_ - I have no formal training in genetics.  I have a B.A. in Neuroscience and Mathematics. I've published 1 research paper. As for forecasting expertise, I am currently rank 62 on Metaculus, with an average Brier score of 0.061 (155 questions). My underconfidence is 26%. Subjectively speaking, I believe that I am slightly above average at making and updating forecasts. More about me can be found [here][about_me].
  - _What are my biases?_ - I am human - [cognitive biases][wiki_biases] apply accordingly; With regard to human gene-editing, my current belief is that it will be GOOD. I am optimistic about the average human future involving human gene-editing for both treatment and enhancement.
  - _How have you atoned for these biases?_ - In this essay, I do not discuss what humanity "should do" with gene-editing, and I have attempted to control for my optimism in my forecasts on people's attitudes towards human gene-editing.
  - _Shortcuts?_ - I operate within the results produced by my initial searches, and haven't considered what fraction of the research landscape I am covering, which means I'm not sure how much I am missing. I did not spend much time learning about gene-editing before writing this, and I did not completely read all the relevant research I came across (I did, however, indicate the extent I engaged with each relevant piece of research). I admit my forecasting analyses are likely missing many considerations.
  - _Epistemic confidence?_ - I would be very surprised if someone scanned the same research literature and came to a different conclusion on people's attitudes towards human gene-editing. I would not be too surprised if someone's forecasts on the questions I have written differed a fair amount from mine (+/- 20%[^forecast]), both at the time of me submitting this and in the future.
  - _Type of support for my claims?_ Most of the claims in my review are supported by findings in the research articles I surveyed, and for the claims that aren't directly supported, I try to make it clear whenever I am speculating, such as when I am investigating causal drivers for some of the  research findings. I believe that my forecasting claims have less support in the sense that they are speculation about human behavior, which I do not presently know how to use the tools to understand well.
  - _Major Inadequacies?_ - I would accuse my report of the following [inadequacies][gleech_metrics]: "Appalling prose", "Could be", and "Stating the Obvious".

[about_me]: https://rodeoflagellum.github.io/me/ "https://rodeoflagellum.github.io/me/"

__Contribution__: In this essay, I have surveyed, at different levels, X published articles on people's attitudes towards human gene-editing. I have aggregated and distilled the survey data from these articles. I've generated 12 forecasting questions related to people's future attitudes towards human gene-editing. My predictions on these questions, along with the forecasting processes I employed, are detailed below. Beyond these things, I emailed X corresponding authors and 1 other author of X published articles the following questions: _What general attitude do you think people will have towards human gene-editing in 2030, 2050, and 2075?_ and _What will be the cumulative number of genetically edited babies born by 2030, 2050, and 2075?_. I have yet to receive any responses, but when I receive at least 5, I will include them below[^referral].

__Priors__[^updates]: Before working on this essay, I want to outline my current thoughts on human gene-editing; doing this might help me better determine how people might update their beliefs after reading this essay. My current understanding of the regulations, technology, and biology of gene-editing comes predominantly from working on my _[Forecasting Designer Babies][designer-babes]_ essay. However, I still do not feel that I strongly understand gene-editing. Floating around in my mind, not well grounded, are the concepts "assisted reproductive technology", "IVF", "CRIPSR-Cas9", "germline genome editing", "somatic cell genome editing", and "treatment vs. enhancement distinction", among others. Each of these I could explain broadly, but if pressed to go deeper, I would fail. Generally speaking, I believe that most Western liberal-leaning people are cautiously optimistic about human gene-editing, that religious and/or older and/or conservative people are less likely to support gene-editing research, that most people are not familiar with what gene-editing entails, and that most people who support gene-editing favor treatment over enhancement.

## [Prospects and Perils](#prospects-perils-gene-editing)

In my life, I discuss gene-editing with friends in the [EA][EA], [Rationality][rationality], and [Forecasting][metaculus] communities. Given my wide-ranging interests in various emerging biotechnologies, I often search for research on gene-editing, but generally am not involved enough to monitor news of progress in the field.

[EA]: https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/ "https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/"

[rationality]: https://www.lesswrong.com/ "https://www.lesswrong.com/"

While this essay is not one that explains, in depth, human genome editing, this brief section on its prospects and perils is aimed at adequately priming you for a discussion on what people think about human it. Of course, most people, including myself, are unfamiliar with the full scope of gene-editing technology, and instead have opinions on their individual _notion_ of what human genome editing entails.

That being said, this section tries to offer a fractional look at the questions:

- What is gene-editing, broadly speaking?
- What is the state of research on human gene-editing?
- What benefits might human gene-editing offer to humanity?
- What concerns for humanity are there with human gene-editing?

That I am not an expert in genetics is a very crucial consideration when you are reading my coverage of human gene-editing; my presentation of the content (it's depth and scope, and the order in which I present things) would likely be very different if I had more experience in the field[^sense_of_the_field].

The next section, which forms the brunt of this essay, actually gets to questions on and related to what people think about gene-editing being performed on humans.

### [Gene-Editing](#gene-editing)

I expect that most people reading this recognize the following terms: genetic engineering, gene-editing, genetically modified organisms, gene therapy, or genome editing. You can find these terms and related concepts in the Glossary of this essay.

> __Gene__ [Def.[^HGE-Book]] — A functional unit of heredity that is a segment of DNA in a specific site on a chromosome. A gene typically directs the formation of a protein or RNA molecule (NRC, 2002, p. 264).
>
> __Gene editing__ [Def.[^HGE-Book]] — A technique that allows researchers to alter the DNA of cells or organisms to insert, delete, or modify a gene or gene sequences to silence, enhance, or otherwise change the gene’s characteristics (NASEM, 2016a, p. 182).

> __Genome__ [Def.[^HGE-Book]] — The complete set of DNA that makes up an organism (NASEM, 2016a, p. 182). In humans, the genome is organized into 23 pairs of ho­mologous chromosomes.
>
> __Genome editing__ [Def.[^HGE-Book]] — The process by which the genome sequence is changed through the intervention of a DNA break or other DNA modification.

> __Gene Therapy__ [Def.[^Bioethics-Dict]] — ... a set of technologies aimed at correcting genes that have been injured (mutations) and cause new diseases as a consequence. Gene therapy involves introducing DNA containing a functioning gene (created by genetically modified viruses) into a patient to correct the effects of a disease-causing mutation. There are two basic types of gene therapy depending on the cells targeted or treated: somatic and germline therapy. Most cells of the human body are somatic cells and transferring DNA to such (differentiated, non-reproductive) cells will just produce effects in this patient without being transmitted to the patient’s off- spring. Cells of the germline are gamete cells (undifferentiated, reproductive), eggs, and sperm and any change in them will be transmitted to the patient’s children

> __Genetic Modification__ [Def.[^Bioethics-Dict]] — Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are those whose genetic material has been altered via genetic engineering such as molecular cloning, recombinant DNA technology, gene delivery in which the three Ts (transformation, transfection, and transduction) are used to introduce foreign DNA, and gene editing.<br> ...the genetic modification or manipulation of an organism today is brought about by using different bioengineering techniques that alter the genome of an organism by introducing or transferring fragments of DNA from other species (transgene) to create a new organism (a GMO) that expresses the desired features.

> __Genetic Engineering__ [Def.[^DNA_book]] — Genetic engineering, also called recombinant DNA technology, involves the group of techniques used to cut up and join together genetic material, especially DNA from different biological species, and to introduce the resulting hybrid DNA into an organism in order to form new combinations of heritable genetic material.

[wiki_GMO]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_organism "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_organism"

These terms all are closely related and sometimes used interchangeably (e.g., genome editing and gene-editing are sometimes used interchangeably[^gene_genome]), but some distinctions between them are worth noting.

My present understanding is that genetic engineering subsumes gene-editing, genome editing, genetic modification, and gene therapy, and that genome editing, gene-editing, and genetic modification are often used interchangeably, but that genome editing and gene therapy are in some instances considered specific forms of gene-editing[^gene_ther_genome_editing], sometimes with the same end in mind. In this essay, I exclusively refer to the act of altering human DNA as human gene-editing or human genome editing.

With regard to human genome editing, there are three primary distinctions, two of which are historical in nature; the last is one that I believe is neglected — in my experience, many people primarily associate "designer babies" (prenatal editing) with human genome editing, but there are in fact many postnatal applications of genome editing.

- (Treatment vs. Enhancement) Interventions
- (Somatic vs. Germline) Editing
- (Prenatal vs. Postnatal) Editing

The historical distinctions are given in[^HGE-Book]:

>In the 1970s, certain central distinctions were drawn (Juengst, 1997; Walters and Palmer, 1997). First, the distinction between somatic and germline genome modifications was established: somatic enhancements affect only a single indi- vidual, but heritable enhancements can be passed down through the generations. Discussions of heritable enhancements included concerns about possible effects on the gene pool and fears of a return to some form of eugenics. Second, a distinction was drawn between treating or preventing disease (therapy) and enhancement. Discussions of enhancement focused on issues such as safety and (especially in competitive environments such as sports) unfair advantage, with the definition of “unfair” highly dependent on context.

[genetic_editing_timeline]: /assets/2022/for_attitudes_gene_editing/docs/genetic_editing_timeline.html

Even without understanding the details of these developments, it's apparent, in my mind, that the science of gene-editing is progressing rapidly. A short overview can be found in the abstract of _Hirakawa et al.'s_ 2020 paper _Gene editing and CRISPR in the clinic: current and future perspectives_[^hirakawa]:

> Genome editing technologies, particularly those based on zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat DNA sequences)/Cas9 are rapidly progressing into clinical trials. [See <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7146048/pdf/bsr-40-bsr20200127.pdf>]

[^hirakawa]: Hirakawa, Matthew P., Raga Krishnakumar, Jerilyn A. Timlin, James P. Carney, and Kimberly S. Butler. "Gene editing and CRISPR in the clinic: current and future perspectives." Bioscience reports 40, no. 4 (2020).

One proxy for validating this is to observe changes in the frequency of terms such as "gene-editing" or, more interestingly, "human gene-editing" over time. Searching "gene-editing" (with the quotes) on Google Scholar (not including citations), we get the following for the years in the closed interval [2000, 2021].

![](/assets/2022/for_attitudes_gene_editing/images/gene_editing_2000-2021.png)

Note that the line indexed with (1) refers to the cumulative number of search results, the line indexed with (2) corresponds to the number of results for each year.

If it is true that search term frequency is closely correlated with research activity, then this above graph implies interest and research in gene-editing is growing tremendously. This is not too surprising given the theoretical benefits gene-editing could afford. I was more surprised to see how abruptly results "human gene-editing" grew.

![](/assets/2022/for_attitudes_gene_editing/images/human_gene_editing_2000-2021.png)

What's missing from this search is the proportion of these research results that concern the ethics surrounding, the governance of, the technology of, and people's attitudes towards human gene-editing (i.e., what is the breakdown for different types of research on human gene-editing); I do not investigate these things in this essay, but would appreciate if anyone can comment on this; my premonition is that most research is technical in nature, with the next largest group being ethics and governance, which in my experience often coincide with each other.

Beyond search term frequency, I believe looking at the number of clinical trials involving gene-editing over time would be useful and interesting.

From[^hirakawa]:

> The U.S. clinical trials database (clinicaltrials.gov) contains all studies which meet the definition of an ‘applicable clinical trial’ initiated on or after 27 September 2007 or continuing beyond 26 December 2007. In addition to trials required to register, voluntary registration is also accepted; studies conducted outside U.S.A., and those which may meet one of the conditions in the future, often register voluntarily. We searched the U.S. clinical trials database (01/01/2020) for any trial containing at least one of the following terms: CRISPR, Cas9, Cas12, Cas13, ZFN, zinc finger, gene edit, gene modification, and genome edit. Trials that did not use the genome editor as part of the therapeutic intervention were excluded from the analysis; these included trials to create cell lines from patients using Cas9; use of patient cells to develop therapeutic strategies, but where the cells were not used as a therapeutic themselves; CRISPR use for genome sequencing; and surveys of opinions regarding human gene editing. This search identified 41 trials utilizing genome editing agents including ZFNs, TALENs, and CRISPR/Cas9 for therapeutic interventions, no studies utilizing Cas12 or Cas13 have been registered (Table 1).

The number of results in _Hirakawa et al.'s_ Table 1 by year (they mention 41 trial results, but there are 50 entities in their Table; I have not resolved this):

![](/assets/2022/for_attitudes_gene_editing/images/trials.png)

Going on <https://clinicaltrials.gov/>, and searching in one case "genome editing", and in the other, "human gene editing", I get:

![](/assets/2022/for_attitudes_gene_editing/images/genome_editing.png)

![](/assets/2022/for_attitudes_gene_editing/images/human_editing.png)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Altering the human genome could afford extensive benefits to humanity, in terms of health and biological capability, but there are simultaneously deleterious outcomes that this technology can engender. As with most emerging technologies, the possible future scenarios involving human gene-editing are diverse.

From my present viewpoint as someone who does not adequately understand the technical landscape of genetics research, the expected value of different plausible futures involving human gene-editing seem difficult to access, and there seems to be strong arguments for and against humanity employing gene-editing in humans.



Given we've now looked at what gene-editing is, and where the state of research on it stands broadly, let's look at the potential affordances and risks of human gene-editing.

One can easily imagine the prospects of altering a human's genes. The following quotes illustrate this to some degree.

> [Genome editing][wiki_genome_editing] is a powerful new tool for making precise additions, deletions, and alterations to the genome an organism’s complete set of genetic material. The development of new approaches—involving the use of [meganucleases][wiki_meganuclease]; [zinc finger nucleases][wiki_zinc_fingers] (ZFNs); [transcription activator-like effector nucleases][wiki_TALENS] (TALENs); and, most recently, the [CRISPR][wiki_CRISPR]/[Cas9][wiki_cas9] system—has made editing of the genome much more precise, efficient, flexible, and less expensive relative to previous strategies. With these advances has come an explosion of interest in the possible applications of genome editing, both in conducting fundamental research and potentially in promoting human health through the treatment or prevention of disease and disability. The latter possibilities range from restoring normal function in diseased organs by editing [somatic cells][wiki_somatic_cell] to preventing genetic diseases in future children and their descendants by [editing the human germline][wiki_germ_edit].

> Human genome editing has great potential to improve human health and medicine. Human genome editing technologies can be used on somatic cells (non-heritable); germline cells (not for reproduction) and germline cells (for reproduction). Potential benefits of human genome editing include new strategies for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of genetic disorders; new avenues to treat infertility; new ways to promote disease resistance; contribution to vaccine development and enhanced knowledge of human biology. For example, application of somatic human genome editing has already been undertaken, including in vivo editing, to address HIV, sickle-cell disease and transthyretin amyloidosis1. Germline human genome editing contributes to deepen our understanding of the role of specific genes and processes in early human development, physiology and diseases. However, there are important areas of ongoing uncertainty as to potential benefits and risks, and gaps in scientific understanding in such key domains as off target effects and long-term risks [See [https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240030381][who_recommendations]].

[who_recommendations]: https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240030381 "https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240030381"

So, gene-editing had the potential to free humanity from genetic diseases.

The [World Health Organization][who] (WHO) created, in 2019, the [Human Genome Editing][hge] (HGE) Registry, which gets it's data from the WHO's [International Clinical Trials Registry Platform][ictrp] (ICTRP).

As of the time of writing this (around May 23 2022), the most recently registered clinical trial has the title _Safety and Efficacy of HMI-103, a Gene Editing Development Candidate in Adults With Classical PKU Due to PAH Deficiency_ (see [here][trial])

> This is an open-label, sequential ascending dose-escalation, Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single intravenous administration of HMI-103, a gene editing development candidate, in adult participants aged 18 to 55 years, inclusive, with classical PKU due to PAH deficiency who have uncontrolled disease despite Phe-restricted dietary management.

A future void of PKU ([^wiki_PKU]) would probably reduce suffering, which most people would consider good. PKU is just one of example of a genetic disorders that gene-editing can help; there are currently

[^wiki_PKU]: "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of metabolism that results in decreased metabolism of the amino acid phenylalanine. Untreated PKU can lead to intellectual disability, seizures, behavioral problems, and mental disorders. It may also result in a musty smell and lighter skin. A baby born to a mother who has poorly treated PKU may have heart problems, a small head, and low birth weight."

From another [paper][another_paper][^another-paper],

Nonetheless, it is very easy to imagine negative events of varying magnitude involving human gene-editing. For example, imagine a scenario where a couple illegally has their child's germline modified, with the good intention of eliminating a heritable disease, and the modifications get carried through to future generations without many people knowing. Such as with mutations in DNA, it might be the case that some of the edits result in unintentional and unnoticeable side effects that are only harmful in select instances. This might not appear too bad on the face of it, but the problem is that the germline edits end up being propagated through the wider human gene pool.

> At the same time, however, somatic, germline and heritable human genome editing raise important and outstanding ethical and social issues. Challenges associated with somatic human genome editing include, for example, rogue clinics, medical travel, as well as the reporting of illegal, unregistered, unethical or unsafe research and other activities including the offer of unproven so-called therapeutic interventions. Heritable human genome editing also gives rise to great concerns as the edit might be passed to subsequent generations. Additional issues include enhancement to improve certain traits, the lack of diversity in collections of human samples and associated data, the need for equity of access to and benefit from human genome editing. There are important differences in the scale of the current challenges posed by somatic, germline and heritable human genome editing [See [https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240030381][who_recommendations]].

A future where...

Here are some more concrete counters and counter-counters against gene-editing

[Vera Lucia Raposo][vera]{:target="_blank"}[^vera-point], in her paper 2019 paper _[The First Chinese Edited Babies: A Leap of Faith in Science][fir_gen]{:target="_blank"}_, provides a nice section on stances taken against human gene-editing. In summary, the four main axes of contention are:

- (1) sanctity of genome
- (2) genetic discrimination and eugenics
- (3) undermining human genetic pool
- (4) loss of human nature

> Ethical concerns have long been asserted against genetic interventions. However, most of the objections have been based more on prejudice than substantive arguments. Critics have invoked the sanctity of the human genome, as if changing it would equate to playing God ([Habermas, 2003][hab]{:target="_blank"}). However, protecting the human genome should not prevent genetic interventions that can improve our lives. What brings real value to our lives is having a genetic code that allows us to live free of severe diseases, not to have an unmodified but unhealthy genetic code. Some have argued the perils of genetic discrimination ([Mehlman & Botkin, 1998][meh]{:target="_blank"}) and eugenics ([Habermas, 2003][hab]{:target="_blank"}), but if that were truth no medical treatment would be allowed under the suspicion of discriminating the ones not that are not treated and of aspiring to create a “superior” society of healthy people. The risk of undermining the human genetic pool ([Committee on Science, Technology, and Law, 2016][com]{:target="_blank"}) is also a recurrent concern, but “there are more than six billion humans on the planet. Absent some kind of magic wand, it is initially difficult to see how any given genetic intervention could change human nature” ([McConnell, 2010][mcc]{:target="_blank"}). The eventual loss of our human nature (Habermas, 2003) has been also invoked, but changing our genes does not change our human nature. Humanity does not reside in a specific genetic code, but in a certain perception of the world and our role in it. That role adds to the story of how we overcome the surrounding environment and ourselves.

A nice thing that portrays vividly the idea of a negative future...

Something that seems less likely to occur in the near-term future, but is still worth discussing due to the severe consequences associated with it, is a post-human-gene-editing-for-enhancement social ecosystem  similar to Erik Hoel's _Nietzschean future_[^hoel-contention] in his post _[How to prevent the coming inhuman future][erik_hoels_inhuman_future]_:

[erik_hoels_inhuman_future]: https://erikhoel.substack.com/p/how-to-prevent-the-coming-inhuman?s=r "https://erikhoel.substack.com/p/how-to-prevent-the-coming-inhuman?s=r"

> The future consists of what the name implies: Übermensch. If we imagine significant genetic editing becoming widespread, we may first simply imagine designer babies, little beings who seem quite unthreatening, just robust and happy creatures with perfect teeth and beautiful eyes. So let’s grow them up and imagine them as designer people, their rich parents having selected their genes specifically for athleticism, competitiveness, IQ, and leadership, with whatever polygenetic profiles those require. They’ll look a lot like the Greek gods. They’ll get into whatever college they want, they’ll never get sick, they’ll run faster, think deeper, and they’ll fuck harder. They will be gorgeous and whip-smart. But, just like the Greek gods, they will be a bunch of petulant, racist, sociopathic superpredators, great in bed but terrible in a relationship. For the sought-after designer traits will likely be things that only give direct selfish benefits, and knowledge of their genetic superiority will likely breed arrogance and contempt.

I imagine that many other people, without having thought extensively about the social and economic forces guiding humanity's reaction to human gene-editing or about the different ways in which gene-editing can be used on humans, might agree with a future in line with Hoel's.

<!-- &emsp; This essay is not an introduction to gene-editing, nor does it seek to comprehensively outline the landscape of debate for or against human gene-editing, but I hope that by adding some exposure to these things, absorbing the current state of people's attitudes towards gene-editing in the following sections will be easier or more enjoyable. -->

## [Treatment $>$ Enhancement](#peoples-thoughts)

While I might still be misperceiving the magnitude of the expected affordances of gene-editing relative to the expected pitfalls (both indirect and direct), or vice versa, my sense is that people believe gene-editing is not risky enough to warrant a full-scale shut down of research on it, and conversely is also not potentially beneficial enough, given the expected risks, to warrant a massive (relative to the current rate of growth) influx of capital investment and research activity.

&emsp; I have found few resources on human gene-editing that explicitly outline the social, regulatory, technological, and/or economics pathways to different treatment and enhancement scenarios, or that actually attach probabilities to any future scenario, example, or consideration involving human gene-editing. It is also possible (and somewhat likely) that I am missing a lot here by not having extensively explored search results such as "human gene-editing scenarios". I will come back to this point, but for now, I imagine that generating considerations and scenarios for what transformative effects gene-editing humans could have on humanity is still important; part of this might involve answering or attempting to answer the following questions on human gene-editing (these apply to both treatment and enhancement):

- When will the first clinical trials involving human genome editing occur?
- How successful will the first clinical trials involving human genome editing be?
- When, if ever, will human gene-editing become widely available?
- When, if ever, will human gene-editing become widely performed?
- In what ways might gene-editing be regulated, if available and/or widely used?
- What are the failure modes for human gene-editing, and how should their severity and likelihood be evaluated?

There are many more questions I could ask here. I suspect one major factor affecting the outcomes of all these questions is people's attitudes towards human gene-editing. While it seems difficult to gauge how much sway the public, bioethicists, and genetics researchers have on how gene-editing is used, it is, at the end of it, human decision-making and the beliefs that guide those decisions that determine whether humans are gene-edited. The following questions

- What influence does the [public, bioethicists, genetics researchers] have on gene-editing research and outcomes?
- What are the public's misperceptions of gene-editing?
- What biases are present in recording the public's attitudes towards gene-editing?[^opinions]

- _What do people currently think about human gene-editing?_
- _Why do people think what they think about human gene-editing?_
- _What will people think about human gene-editing?_  
- _Why is what people think / will think about human gene-editing important to humanity's future?_

In my mind, the main objective in investigating and forecasting people's attitudes towards human gene-editing is an attempt to understand how humanity is currently reacting to the potential of altering humans using the transformative technology of gene-editing. Should contemporaneous gene-editing practices come to be performed on humans en-masse, it seems likely that much suffering could be averted in the

## [Appendix](#appendices)

### [The Landscape](#landscape)

Before writing this report, I had to gauge the landscape of research on people's attitudes towards human gene-editing. To do this, I came up with a list of search terms that I thought might be useful.

I began by searching for "human gene editing survey" on OpenAlex, looking at years in the interval [2016, 2021]. I did not include results from the search that I thought weren't especially relevant to people's attitudes towards human gene-editing (e.g., the OpenAlex query <https://api.openalex.org/works?search=Human%20Gene%20Editing%20Survey&filter=publication_year:2021> produces the result "_Consumer valuation of and attitudes towards novel foods produced with new plant engineering techniques: A review_", but I did not include this). Next, I searched for "attitudes towards human gene-editing" on Google, looking at the first 3 pages of results (this means clicking "More Results" 2 times) on FireFox.

It's worth noting that each search did not include quotation marks; this means that my searches were not for the exact phrases _human gene editing survey_ or _attitudes towards human gene-editing_ (e.g., "attitudes toward human gene-editing" means I searched [attitudes toward human gene-editing] not ["attitudes toward human gene-editing"]).

I conducted my searches during the first 15 days of May 2022. Ideally, I would search for all of the terms in the Search Terms list on all of the following platforms: Google Scholar, CrossRef, OpenAlex, and Google.

There are many search terms listed below, but I only ended up searching for "human gene editing survey" on OpenAlex and "attitudes towards human gene-editing" on Google. I noticed that there were many articles repeated in my second search (I did not include duplicates between searches), and decided that searching the remaining terms would not be worth my time, given the diminishing returns. Also, I anticipated that, if I found myself still requiring more evidence or surveys, I could always look in the references of the works I already had.

In the query-lists below (OpenAlex Queries and Google Queries), the list structure is organized in the following manner: the outermost list is what I searched (a query, phrase, or a remark indicating that I forgot what I originally searched); the next sub-list contains the relevant results returned from that query or phrase; and all subsequent nested lists are the works I found from looking at the references or links of a specific result.

Research that I found later on as a result of looking up references or links of works from the search results are included under "Other Research". The "Table of Covered Research" refers to the primary research works I base much of my analysis and forecasting off of. Any work that I referenced in this post but that is not included in the "Table of Covered Research" has a citation in the footnotes.  

<!-- Made the mistake in this first search pass in including results on the ethics of gene-editing, and not removing those.
This does not apply to other research.  -->

### [Expert Questioning](#expert-questioning)

Asking people for help or information is a relatively low-cost enterprise, so I took the time to email most of the authors whose research I included in the "Table of Covered Research". In total, I sent 24 emails on 05/15/2022 and, as of 05/19/2022, have received 0 responses. I've included the template I used, along with the responses I received.

#### *Templates*

Thank you Ryan Beck and Ege Erdil for providing some feedback on the first of these two templates. The first template was sent to 1 researcher. I revised the first template to only address the corresponding authors of the articles I listed in "Table of Covered Research". If the another author's email was present in the research document, I emailed them as well.

__Template 1__

To reduce space, and since I only used this template once, I've copied it over to a text file; see [here][template_1].

> Title: Forecasting Gene-Editing - [my actual name]
>
> Dear [Author],
>
> I am writing a short literature review (informal) on attitudes people have towards human gene-editing, for both enhancement and treatment purposes, with the goal of forecasting how people's attitudes might change in the coming years. My essay will be hosted on [Metaculus.com ](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/) (a crowd forecasting platform that focuses on scientific and technological change). I am not affiliated with Metaculus, but do forecast there.
>
I recently came across your work [paper I read] in my review, and really find it useful. Given your experience with research directly involved with or adjacent to gene-editing, I am interested in hearing your thoughts on the following questions (*):
>
Q1: __What general attitude do you think people will have towards human gene-editing in 2030, 2050, and 2075?__
>
> and
>
>
Q2: __What will be the cumulative number of genetically edited babies born by 2030, 2050, and 2075?__
>
> Any thoughts on these questions from you (and your research colleagues), even brief ones, would be helpful. It would also be helpful if you specified, on a scale of 0-100, what you believe is your current level of familiarity with human gene-editing.
>
>  Once I am finished with the review, I will have a set of 5-10 forecasting questions that operationalize this area of study. If you are interested in these more formal questions on people's attitudes towards gene-editing (I would love to hear your thoughts on these as well) or in the review, I can reach out to you again when they're ready.
>
> Thank you for taking the time to read this! I really appreciate it.
>
> Kind Regards,<br>
> [My actual name]
>
> (*) An example response my look like: My familiarity: 23/100; Q1: Same trend, people are much less supportive of enhancement than treatment, until ~2050. Q2: 95% confidence intervals for 2030, 2050, and 2075, respectively: 1-25000, 100-1.5m, 10k-25m

[^forecast]: This is a tentative estimate, and is more in line with how much I think people's opinions will differ from might. I would consider a small difference in forecasts to be around 10%, and a large one to be around 35%. What constitutes a "small" and "large" difference in forecasts probably differs somewhat between people. I would appreciate if you share your forecasts for the questions in this essay in the comments and outline your reasoning. I would also appreciate critiques of my forecasts, as I am typically underconfident.

<!-- (Get some forecasts from friends; reference Yudkowsky's attitudes essay ) -->

[^vera-point]: Raposo, Vera Lucia. "The first Chinese edited babies: a leap of faith in science." JBRA assisted reproduction 23, no. 3 (2019): 197. <br><br> Note that I recycled the list and blockquote relating to Vera's paper from my other essay _[Forecasting Designer Babies][designer-babes]_.

[^timeline]: I searched "timeline of human gene-editing" in FireFox on 05/17/2022, looked at the first page of results, and found the timeline that looked the most useful (where usefulness  = some mental function of credibility and comprehensiveness). I chose the [timeline][genetic_editing_timeline] on <https://www.synthego.com/learn/genome-engineering-history> and added links to Wikipedia pages; Synthego claims of itself: <br>"_Synthego is a genome engineering company that enables the acceleration of life science research and development in the pursuit of improved human health. <br><br> The company leverages machine learning, automation, and gene editing to build platforms for science at scale. With its foundations in engineering disciplines, the company’s platform technologies vertically integrate proprietary hardware, software, bioinformatics, chemistries, and molecular biology to advance basic research, target validation, and clinical trials. <br><br> With its technologies cited in hundreds of peer-reviewed publications and utilized by thousands of commercial and academic researchers and therapeutic drug developers, Synthego is at the forefront of innovation enabling the next generation of medicines by delivering genome editing at an unprecedented scale._"

[^updates]: Once the essay is written and submitted, I will post a brief update of my beliefs in the comments.

[^sense_of_the_field]: This statement is supported for me by my anecdotal experience that, after reading another research paper or book chapter on human genome editing, the distinctions I make and the scope of what I believe should be discussed in a purview of human genome editing, among others things, alter largely from what I had written before being exposed to the additional content.

[^referral]: If you know anyone with genetics training, I would appreciate if you asked them these questions and referred them to me.

[^gene_genome]: I cannot remember where exactly that I saw this, but in a research paper, I observe "genome editing (a.k.a gene-editing)".

[^DNA_book]: Rosenberg, Eugene. It's in Your DNA: From Discovery to Structure, Function and Role in Evolution, Cancer and Aging. Academic Press, 2017. <br><br> Note that I am citing this definition from Chapter 10: Genetic Engineering of this book.  

[^questions-gene-editing]: I asked these questions, as well as the one in the section on gene-editing ethics and governance, without having read much on gene-editing. Given this, the questions I ask may not be the most important considerations for the biology, technology, ethics, and governance of gene-editing. I did not go back and revise these questions after learning more about gene-editing. Any considerations for revisions would be appreciated.

[^hoel-contention]: I am inclined to be somewhat skeptical of this being a plausible future. I imagine that aggression and other emotions important to coordination and relationships could also be modified in the enhancement future Hoel outlines. Across many socio-economic and demographic strata, most people I've seen want their children to be kind. I don't think it's likely that parents wouldn't select [kindness, compassion, morality, etc...] if they were available alongside things like IQ, creativity, and competitiveness.  

[^intro-thoughts]: The extent of this introduction was guided how much I felt I needed to understand gene-editing to write this essay, and by my desire to limit the content on gene-editing relative to people's attitudes on it - bringing back up the thought "this is an essay on attitudes towards gene-editing, not gene-editing" helped with this.

[^HGE-Book]: National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. Human genome editing: science, ethics, and governance. National Academies Press, 2017. <br><br> Notes: I used this book (Chapters 3 and 4, and the Appendices) to learn about gene-editing science and regulation, and most of the content in this essay's gene-editing section and glossary section come from my reading of this text.

[^gene_ther_genome_editing]: From[^HGE-Book] pp. 106, <br><br>"_Like traditional gene therapy, somatic genome editing could be used to revert an underlying genetic mutation to a variant not associated with disease, which would result in a fraction of the targeted cells regaining normal function. Somatic genome editing also could be used to engineer a cell so that its phenotype differed from that of a normal cell and was better able to resist or prevent disease._"

[^opinions]: I believe I should be thinking more about how opinions change over time, and about how people's self-reported opinions are biased. Here are some considerations (maybe a simple Google search would suffice): (1) how do people's views change, (2) opinion drift, (3) how attitudes change, (4) how opinions change, (5) how often do opinions change, (6) response bias, (7) measuring response bias, and (8) self-reported data issues.


<!-- [^]: Pew Research Center, March 2022, “AI and Human Enhancement: Americans’ Openness Is Tempered by a Range of Concerns” <br><br> Notes:  <br><br> Quotes: "_Americans strongly support using gene editing techniques for people’s therapeutic needs. But, when it comes to their potential use to enhance human health over the course of a lifetime by reducing a baby’s risk of getting serious diseases or conditions, as many Americans think this would be a bad idea for society as say it would be a good idea. The public is also closely divided over whether they would want this for their own baby. As with previous Pew Research Center surveys on this topic, women and more religious Americans are less accepting of gene editing for this purpose._" -->

<!-- Hello, I am a recently graduated student of Neuroscience and Mathematics from [college], and I am writing a forecasting review of people's attitudes towards human gene-editing. Part of this review is creating forecasting questions. For example, on a PEW Research Center report from 2020, 56% of Indian respondents found gene-editing an appropriate use of science, so we may ask, what % of Indian respondents will find gene-editing an appropriate use of science in 2025? My problem here is that the PEW Research Center and other organizations involved with surveying people's takes on gene-editing are not guaranteed to consistently conduct these surveys. My "ask" to NHGRI is an answer to whether the NHGRI will conduct a survey on people's attitudes towards human gene-editing in the next 10 years, and whether I can talk to a genetics-researcher about this topic (I am interested in aggregating expert opinions on these forecasting questions). Thank you for reading all of this, and I wish you the best!

Kind regards,
name -->


<!-- Gene-editing does not come up in many conversations I have, and when I do mention it, my fairly neurotypical Western friends and family react mostly with cached concern-oriented thoughts such as "If everyone was intelligent, there would be no garbage men (my grandma)" and "Isn't that eugenics?" -->

<!-- _What do people think about tampering with human genes?_
