__Takeaways__:

__Disclaimer__:

__Contribution__: I have read or skimmed 35 papers relating to human gene-editing. Of these papers, 14 include a survey, 5 consist of ethical considerations, and 5 relate to general gene-editing. I contribute 12 new forecasting questions on the subject.

This essay somewhat decently aggregates the ideas and survey responses concerning people's notions of human gene-editing from 35 papers.

 presents offers a brief introduction to gene-editing..

## [Appendix](#appendices)

### [The Landscape](#landscape)

For some of the sections below (e.g., OpenAlex Queries), the list structure is organized in the following manner: the outermost list is what I searched (a query, phrase, or explanation); the next indented list are the results I found directly from that query or phrase; and all subsequent nested lists are results I found from looking at the references or links in those results. I did not include the quotes when I searched for a phrase (e.g., "attitudes toward human gene-editing" means I searched [attitudes toward human gene-editing] not ["attitudes toward human gene-editing"]). The "here" links will open a PDF of the research or an HTML page; if there is a "?" that means I couldn't find the paper. If I come across a research work that appeared in an earlier search, I do not include it more than once.

#### Search Phrases

These are the search terms I originally intended to look through. I did not get through all of them - the ones I did not look into are italicized. As you can see, most are italicized. After searching for "human gene editing survey", I already began experiencing diminishing returns with the search "attitudes towards human gene-editing". I expect that for many of these queries below, I would get many of the same results. I believe that the 35 search hits I got from simply searching "human gene editing survey" and "attitudes towards human gene-editing" are sufficient for this essay. I expect to find many more results when I comb through the references and links in these articles more extensively. I conduct the searching below during the first 15 days of May 2022. Ideally, I would search for all of these phrases on Google Scholar, CrossRef, OpenAlex, and Google.

### [Expert Questioning](#expert-questioning)

For each paper that I skimmed or read, I emailed the authors something similar to the following:

> Dear [Author],
>
> I am writing a short literature review (informal) on attitudes people have towards human gene-editing, for both enhancement and treatment purposes, with the goal of forecasting how people's attitudes might change in the coming years. This essay will be hosted on Metaculus.com (a crowd forecasting platform that focuses on scientific and technological change). I do not work for Metaculus but forecast there.
>
I recently came across your work [paper I read] in my review, and really found [this part] helpful. Given your experience with research directly involved with or adjacent to [gene-editing topic], I am interested in hearing your thoughts on the topic: __How might people's attitudes on human gene-editing be different 10, 25, or 50 years from now, say in 2030, 2050, and 2075?__ Any thoughts, even brief ones, would be welcome. If you share thoughts, I think it would be helpful for forecasters if I included them in my review - I could anonymously quote you if you want.
>
>  Also, once I am finished with the review, I will have a set of 5-10 forecasting questions that operationalize this area of study (e.g., "On the next PEW Research Center survey on human gene-editing, what percentage of Indian respondents will find scientific research on gene-editing appropriate?). If this question seems difficult, don't worry, the review will present enough background information to make a proper judgement. If you are interested in these types of inquiries about the future, I can share them with you, and would love to hear your thoughts on them as well.
>
> Thank you for taking the time to read this! I really appreciate it.
>
> Kind Regards,<br>
> [My actual name]
