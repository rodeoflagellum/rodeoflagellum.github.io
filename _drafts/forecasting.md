> Tversky and Kahneman (1974) originally discussed three main heuristics:
availability, representativeness, and anchoring-and-adjustment. Research on
judgemental forecasting suggests that the type of information on which
forecasts are based is the primary factor determining the type of heuristic that
people use to make their predictions. Specifically, availability is used when
forecasts are based on information held in memory; representativeness is
important when the value of one variable is forecast from explicit information
about the value of another variable; and anchoring-and-adjustment is
employed when the value of a variable is forecast from explicit information
about previous values of that same variable.

The 80% Forecasting Solution
https://www.overcomingbias.com/2006/12/the_80_forecast.html
> We often have remarkably poor forecasts, relative to the information around.   An exciting new way to do better is prediction markets; have people bet on your topic.  But honestly, I’d guess you can get 80% of the improvement that predict markets offer by using a much simpler solution: collect track records.

> Yup, it’s that simple.   When people make forecast-like-statements, write them down in a clear standardized form, and then check back later to see who was more accurate.   Along the way, create a consensus forecast by averaging recent forecasts, perhaps weighted by accuracy or expert credentials.   If you collect enough forecasts to evaluate accuracy, and reward accuracy well enough, people will try hard to be right, and you’ll learn what kinds of people to listen to.
