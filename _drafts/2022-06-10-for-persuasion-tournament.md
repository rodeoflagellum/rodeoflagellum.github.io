description: "The extent of my participation in Philip Tetlock's Hybrid Forecasting Persuasion Tournament. "
---

__Overview__: _On 06/08/2022, I was invited to participate in Philip's Tetlock's Hybrid Forecasting-Persuasion Tournament. While I was not in the "core group of experts", I supposedly had enough "qualified background and experience" to participate, generally, and I looked forward to this event from an outside view. How difficult is it be for people to predict rares events ([global catastrophes][wiki_cata]) which, if they transpired, would be horrible for humanity? Recorded in this post are my thoughts, predictions, and reflections on the tournament as it occurred, posted $\geq 4$ months after the tournament was over._

## Questions 

### 1. Genetically Engineered Pathogen Risk 

> What is the probability that a genetically-engineered pathogen will be the cause of death, within a 5-year period, for more than 1% of humans alive at the beginning of that period...
- ...by the end of 2030?
- ...by the end of 2050?
- ...by the end of 2100?
> 
> Question and resolution details
> 
> - A pathogen is any microorganism (bacteria, viruses, etc.) that can cause diseases. 
- For the purposes of this question, an engineered pathogen is one produced via genetic modification or manipulation by humans. This may include the laboratory modification of pathogens that have previously been found in nature.
- In order to resolve positively, the relevant 5-year period must end before the resolution date.
- If reasonable people disagree about whether this event has occurred, this question will be resolved via a panel of experts.

#### Stage 1 

__Considerations__: As of (06/26/2022), there are around 7,956,600,000 billion people alive today[^world_o_meter1] - 1% of this is almost 80m people, so the temporally normalized perceived severity of this pandemic could "in 2022, a pandemic severe enough that 80m people die in the next 5 years". For context, as of (06/26/2022), there have been ~6.351b deaths[^deaths] from SARS-CoV-2[^world_o_meter2], which might have leaked from a laboratory[^leak], possibly following genetic modifications.  There are ~8.5 years (~1.7 five year periods) until the end of 2030, ~28.5 years (~5.7 five year periods) until the end of 2050, and ~78.5 years (~15.7 five year periods) until the end of 2100.

[^deaths]: This does not take into account excess deaths. "...taking into account likely COVID induced deaths via [excess deaths][wiki_excess], the 95% confidence interval suggests the pandemic to have caused between 14.7 and 24.9 millions deaths." See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_deaths>.

There are presently alive, so 1% of this is this There are x years until 2030, y years until 2050, and z until 2100. The UN expects there to be 

__Naive Attitude__: For 2030, my sense is that the odds are somewhere between 1:850 and 1:15000. In probabilities, this is 1/851 to 1/15000. The approx. geometric average of this is 1:(8.5+1.5)/2 x 10^(2+4)/2 = 1:5000 = 1/5001 = 0.0002 = ~0.02%. Going off of n = 8.5 trials with ~0.02% the constant annual probability would be p = ~0.0002, since 0.0002 = 1 - (1 - p)^{8.5}, so for n = 28.5, p = 0.00568, and for n = 78.5, p = 0.01557.

### 2. Non-Genetically Engineered Pathogen Risk 

> What is the probability that a non-genetically-engineered pathogen will be the cause of death, within a 5-year period, for more than 1% of humans alive at the beginning of that period...
- ...by the end of 2030?
- ...by the end of 2050?
- ...by the end of 2100?
>
> Question and resolution details
>
- A pathogen is any microorganism (bacteria, viruses, etc…) that can cause diseases.
- A naturally arising pathogen is any pathogen that was not produced via genetic modification or manipulation by humans. If there is a lab escape of a naturally arising pathogen that has not been genetically modified or manipulated (e.g. smallpox), this would count as a "naturally arising pathogen" for the purposes of this question. 
- In order to resolve positively, the relevant 5-year period must end before the resolution date.
- If reasonable people disagree about whether this event has occurred, this question will be resolved via a panel of experts.

### 3. AI Catastrophe Risk 

> What is the probability that artificial intelligence will be the cause of death, within a 5-year period, for more than 10% of humans alive at the beginning of that period...
- ...by the end of 2030?
- ...by the end of 2050?
- ...by the end of 2100?
>
> Question and resolution details
> 
- Artificial intelligence is defined here as ‘the development of machines capable of sophisticated (intelligent) information processing (Dafoe 2018, AI Governance: A Research Agenda; See pg 5 footnote 2 for more.)
- We use the term “be the cause of death” to cover cases where AI is the direct or proximate cause of the deaths. For example, if a terminator-style robot powered by AI kills 10% of all humans alive at the time within a 5-year period, that will count for this question. Alternatively, if AI, operating without direct human intervention, causes the launch of nuclear weapons that kill 10% of all humans alive at the time, that will also count for the purposes of this question. And if that same incident does not kill 10% of all humans, but the subsequent nuclear winter does, that will also count for the purposes of this question.
- If reasonable people disagree about whether this event has occurred, this question will be resolved via a panel of experts.

> From "Superforecasting" (Appendix: Ten Commandments for Aspiring Superforecasters)
> 
> (1) Triage. (2) Break seemingly intractable problems into tractable sub-problems. (3) Strike the right balance between inside and outside views. (4) Strike the right balance between under- and overreacting to evidence. (5) Look for the clashing causal forces at work in each problem. (6) Strive to distinguish as many degrees of doubt as the problem permits but no more. (7) Strike the right balance between under- and overconfidence, between prudence and decisiveness. (8) Look for the errors behind your mistakes but beware of rearview-mirror hindsight biases. (9) Bring out the best in other and let others bring out the best in you. (10) Master the error-balancing cycle. (11) Don't treat commandments as commandments.

> The reason you are unlikely to get good results using classification or regression methods is that these methods typically depend on predicting the conditional mean of the data, and extreme events are usually caused by the conjunction of "random" factors all aligning in the same direction, so they are in the tails of the distribution of plausible outcomes, which are usually a long way from the conditional mean. What you can do is to predict the whole conditional distribution, rather than just its mean, and get some information on the probability of an extreme event by integrating the tail of the distribution above some threshold. I found this worked well in an application on statistical downscaling of heavy precipitation.
