During the summer of 2021, I began to consume substantially more blended drinks than I had ever. Every day I would make 1-3 blended drinks, and typically had my partner (PurpleFern) and her sister rate them on scales of viscousity (1.0/10.0), coldness (1.0/10.0), and taste (1.0/10.0), and then give an overall rating (1-100). I made all of the drinks.
