Whenever you come across writing, resources, reading, ideas, quotes, etc...
see how they can add to the pages you have in drafts

Look at Wikipedia pages and pages and pages of the concepts you want to look at
Use OpenAlex
Find subjective reports of things on HackerNews, Reddit, Quora, Twitter when applies
Use SciHub, INternet Archives,
Look at Google Scholar, Semantic Search, etc... to find research on the topics

have heuristics (statistics, forecasting, probability, economics, psychology) for
determining how accurate a piece of writing actually is

How do I categorize different questions on a subject?
How do I prioritize these questions?
How do I prioritize what I spend my time on?

When I find a piece of information, how should I frame its integration with what I am
writing.

Pull quotes, research papers,

I want to have a section of my website that just contains forecasts
and that makes use of the all of the forecasting principes I discuss

There should be an active method of getting better at forecasting using
existing methods; measuring how good I am at forecasting; developing new
methods of forecasting; and evaluating where I went wrong

Have multiple site versions; one just black text
one with pcitures

Have something if your posted this elsewhere
