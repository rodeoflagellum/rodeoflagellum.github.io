Whenever you come across writing, resources, reading, ideas, quotes, etc...
see how they can add to the pages you have in drafts

Look at Wikipedia pages and pages and pages of the concepts you want to look at
Use OpenAlex
Find subjective reports of things on HackerNews, Reddit, Quora, Twitter when applies
Use SciHub, INternet Archives,
Look at Google Scholar, Semantic Search, etc... to find research on the topics

have heuristics (statistics, forecasting, probability, economics, psychology) for
determining how accurate a piece of writing actually is

How do I categorize different questions on a subject?
How do I prioritize these questions?
How do I prioritize what I spend my time on?

color coating tags by class
navy blue: specific -->
blue : general -->
light blue : broad -->
have superscript number for the "site weight of the tag",
which might help people notice "Hey he's written a lot about this"

What information to present, what information to leave out?
What are the funneling questions?

When I find a piece of information, how should I frame its integration with what I am
writing.

At the end of this post, you should have a grasp of the following:

Pull quotes, research papers,
statistics, statements, etc...

I want to have a section of my website that just contains forecasts
and that makes use of the all of the forecasting principes I discuss
elsewhere on the site
There should be an active method of getting better at forecasting using
existing methods; measuring how good I am at forecasting; developing new
methods of forecasting; and evaluating where I went wrong

Have multiple site versions; one just black text
one with pcitures

Have something if your posted this elsewhere
Follow Gwern's checklists

Do what Gwern and the others dont

Subreddits to follow;
useful Reddit comments;
best of reddit subreddits;

Time spent thinking (TST) for entries in a list
TST 1 (~1 minute)
TST 2 (~5 minute)
TST 3 (~10 minutes)
TST 4 (~1 hour)
TST 5 (~2 hour)
TST 6 (> 2 hours)

Have dream content images be AI generated art

Look at LessWrong tags to illustrate a better pictures of your
posts https://www.lesswrong.com/tags/all

untill you read and observe, you have no idea what's going on

Think of KEY questions for each tag

How to differentiate between communication best
practices and your own style;

What is this?
  Has work on this already been done on this?
  Does this idea already exist?
  How much time have you spent researching on this?
  How much should I trust or believe this?
  What next?

Why is this being posted here?
  Is this a waste of my time? Is it valuable? Is it practical?
  If other work has already been done, why not just read that?

Notebook

[000] Come up with descriptions for each of the tags
[000] Come up with tag systems "There should be 1-5 general categories,
and 1-2 specific categories"
[000] There should be no more than X tags per post? What is X, and how do
you decide?
