__Disclaimer__: I began writing notes on this page on 07/18/0002022; given how late in life I've started such a log, there have been many major alterations in my subjective states in the past that have gone unrecorded and un-analyzed. The start date for this page explains the paucity of content here.

## Main Log 

- 07/19/0002022:  Very fractured sleep this morning. Consumed smoothie with almond milk, blueberries, strawberries, bee pollen, "moon balance" powder, and "plant collagen" powder ~30 minutes before bed at 11:30pm. Consumed Matcha Green Tea ~5-6pm yesterday.  Consumed ramen ~5pm yesterday. Believe that no other snacks were consumed ~5-11pm yesterday. Mind still operating in similar state to 07/16/0002022, but effects of sleep loss are noticeable. less able to mentally attend, stronger inclination to listen to music. Still able to do math well, but get distracted more easily. 
- 07/16/0002022: Extreme shift in subjective experience following consumption of Nicotinamide pill followed by a smoothie with peas, bee pollen, maca powder,  mixed berries, chia seeds, and water (this experience is why I've created this page).  Noticeably calmer, significantly easier to think, much easier to concentrate for long durations, negative effects of coffee were weaker - subjectively, I felt the best I had in at least the last 2 years.
