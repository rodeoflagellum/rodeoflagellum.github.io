<span class="padded-dropcap">I</span> would like to like to experience _[eudemonia][wiki_eu]_ — "state or condition of 'good spirit'". My decisions for what to do and experience influence this, at least marginally (while I don't have the evidence on deck, I suspect that a large fraction of one's life satisfaction is attributable to their genetics). 

The art of the good decision making is something I would like to learn and put to work. There are communities, such as LessWrong and EA, with better-than-base-US-society epistemics in this regard, but there is still much room for improvement.

This page consists of me trying out and testing different practices, methods, learnings, etc... that I've come across on my own decisions. I don't have any plans to narrow or expand the scope of this page, and do not have a clear vision of where it will go. I am excited to see how I might benefit from and fail at using these methods. 

[wiki_eu]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudaimonia "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudaimonia"

I would be interested to see if many people in the LW / EA communities explicitly outline their options every few weeks or months and update upon gaining experience following the making of their decision. 

The following list includes things I mostly want to do more of / do more effectively:

## Untools 


> [Untools][untools] is a collection of thinking tools and frameworks to help you solve problems, make decisions and understand systems.

[untools]: https://untools.co/ "https://untools.co/"

There are some methods for decision-making here that I would like to employ. In some cases, these tools are obvious and intuitive ("I already am doing these things!"); however, I oftentimes find that I fail to formally process what actions are available to me and which might be in my best interest. Even if obvious, getting a more adequate lay of the land seems helpful and low cost. Begin!

__Second-order thinking__ 

> Consider a decision you have to make. Start by looking at the most immediate effects of making this decision – the first order.
> 
> Then for each of the effect ask yourself: "And then what?" That's how you examine the second order of this decision's consequences. You can repeat this for as many orders as you find practical.
> 
> Alternatively, think about the decision in different timelines. Ask yourself: What will be the consequences of this decision in
> 
> - 10 minutes? 
- 10 months?
- 10 years?

__Six Thinking Hats__

> - Yellow hat is about positivity. Try seeing the benefits of this decision and what opportunities it opens.
- Green hat represents creativity. Let your mind run free and generate ideas without censoring them. Try coming up with creative options and solutions. Tools like the Productive Thinking Model or First Principles can help you.
- Red hat is about emotions. How do you feel about this? Use your intuition and gut feelings. Try to see how others might react emotionally. It's a great way to bring emotions into an otherwise rational process.
- White hat makes you focus on the data. Analyze the available data and trends. This represents a very rational approach.
- Black hat represents looking at the downside. What are the worst-case scenarios? Take a defensive approach, imagine any potentially negative outcomes, see what might not work. Inversion might be a helpful tool here.
- Blue hat is for controlling the process. Especially in meetings, it's good to be able to step in when there's no progress and enable the group to move forward (e.g. by shifting the thinking or discussion to a different hat/perspective).

__Eisenhower Matrix__ 

> The Eisenhower Matrix has four quadrants along two axes: importance and urgency. For every activity or task, ask yourself: It is important or not? Is it urgent or not?

__Ladder of Inference__

> First, identify on which step of the ladder you currently are. Are you about to take action and you're not sure if it's the right one? Or perhaps you're aware of some of the assumptions you're making?
> 
> Then work your way down before building your reasoning up again. To work your way down the ladder, use these guiding questions for each step:
> 
> - Actions:
    - Why do I believe this to be the right action? What are some alternative options?
- Beliefs:
    - What beliefs do I hold about this? What conclusions are they based on?
- Conclusions:
    - Why did I conclude this? What are my assumptions there?
- Assumptions:
    - Are my assumptions valid? Why am I assuming this? 
- Interpretations:
    - Am I looking at this data objectively? What other meanings could they have?
- Selected data:
    - What did I ignore or didn't pay attention to? Are there other sources of data I didn't consider?
> 
> As you answer these, you may find that your reasoning changes along the way and that's good. When you reach the bottom of the ladder, work your way back up again, this time more consciously and deliberately.

__Decision Matrix__ 

> Decision matrix is basically a simple table with your options and factors for deciding. The goal is to calculate a score for each option based on their factor scores. The score will help you make your decision.
> 
> Here's how to create a decision matrix step by step:
> 
> - Write down the decision you need to make
- List the options you have
- Identify factors that you want to consider
- Score the options on each factor
- Add weight to the factors
- Calculate the options' scores – multiply each score by the factor weight, then add them up.
- Pick your winner – option with the highest score

__Hard Choice Model__ 

> Think about two factors of your decision:
> 
> - How impactful it is
- How easy it is to compare the options

## Decision Evaluation 

Incorporating these into a program...

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
import sys

FILE = "decisions.csv"

def add_decision():
    # Metrics for sorting decisions 
    decision_matrix = {
        "Decision":"",
        "Urgency":"",
        "Importance":"",
        "Impactfulness":"",
        "ECT":"",  
        "Error":""  
    }
    # Other metics for whether to add or remove certain decisions 
    # "Preference":"","Interest":"","YHat":"","GHat":"","RHat":"",
    # "WHat":"","BlkHat":"","BluHat":"","Frequency":"",
    print("Make sure to do [number]:[response]")
    for k in list(decision_matrix.keys()):
        decision_matrix[k] = input(f"{k}: ")
    print("You've entered the following")
    print(list(decision_matrix.keys()))
    while True: 
        ans = input(f"Alter? (n/[key]):")
        try: 
            if ans == "n":
                break  
            else: 
                decision_matrix[ans] = input(f"{ans}: ")
        except: 
            print("Oops, reenter.")
    with open(FILE, "a") as f:
        line = ','.join(list(decision_matrix.values()))
        f.write(line)
        f.close()

def main():
    options = {
        "Add":add_decision,
    }
    using = True 
    while using: 
        for k, v in options.items():
            print(k)
        try: 
            choice = input("What would you like to do? (\"n\" for no, [choice]): ")
            if choice != "n":
                options[choice]()
            else:
                sys.exit()
        except: 
            print("\nSomething went awry, please try again.\n")
        
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The need to clarify "value classes" came up in my decision making explorations. Listed below are rough reference classes for the different decision parameters I am taking into account. 

- Decision: The decision I want to make 
- Error: How incorrect I am in a "good" direction vs. in a "poor" direction. For example, a score of 50 means that I was mostly on point with the values, and a score of 98 means that something was much better overall than I expected (this could be in terms of completion time, importance, YHat, ...). All error scores start at 50.
