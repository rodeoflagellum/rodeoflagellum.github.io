Thank you for writing this. Here are some notes / ideas I took while reading. 

> This “celebrating failures” notion is a celebration of both the audacity to try and the humility to learn and change course. It’s a great ideal. I wholeheartedly support it

Something I remembered when reading this was the idea, which most people here might have been exposed to at one point of another but might have forgotten, that "Adding is favoured over subtracting in problem solving" (https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00592-0). 

I believe that making it easy for people, organizations, etc... to remember that subtractive solutions exist or to implement them would probably be a GOOD thing in EA. I think collectively reinterpreting failures, in some instances, as a subtractive solutions could further this. 

> However, I fear that without taking meaningful steps towards it we'll fall far short of this ideal, resulting in people burning out, increased reputational risks for the community, and ultimately, significantly reduced impact.

> For one thing, private sector entrepreneurship can be a very toxic environment (which is partly why I left).  

I am not at all familiar with private sector entrepreneurship, but can say that I am grateful for the occassional (availability heuristic working here, I am only recollecting the past year or so of posts) mental-health post on EAF. These posts upweight the importance of taking breaks and doing other, less taxing activities in fighting the urge to ruthlessly optimize my behavior and get many things done and in avoiding burnout.

I also find that after a break or walk I have an easier time with the work I was doing. For me, and probably for many others, long-term effectiveness at thought-work requires some periods of low-intensity activity. 

Interesting link <https://www.fuckupnights.com/>; I didn't know such a thing existed. 

I feel as though this list can be expanded somewhat. 

> So how can we avoid these pitfalls? A few thoughts: 
- We can’t expect too many people to be entrepreneurs. 
- We need to be careful that we don't put people in situations where they're set up to fail unnecessarily.
- We can’t just celebrate the failures of those who eventually succeed.

To be more clear, are the pitfalls in "high-risk, high-reward approach[es] to achieving great successes" the following? 

- Rapid turnover rate, due to abundant failures and burnout, among other things like stress and that the work is demoralizing
- If a failure is celebrated, it is mostly likely a failure that was followed by a noticable success, which is likely not characteristic of most failures 

<!-- [i.e., we can't expect most people to be able to pursue "high-risk, high-reward" strategies for achievement in EA, given the associated pitfalls] -->

I've thought of two additional points that might help avoid these pitfalls and that might also be instrumental towards "help[ing] us fail more gracefully, fail less grotesquely... or even better, fail less (while still achieving more)."

- We shouldn't expect people to handle being entrepreneurs for too long
- We should track failures and other inadequacices, rather than shying away from them, so that they can be prevented routinely
