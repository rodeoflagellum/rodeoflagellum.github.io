Dear AUTHOR,

I am writing a short literature review (informal) on attitudes people have towards human gene-editing, for both enhancement and treatment purposes, with the goal of forecasting how people's attitudes might change in the coming years. My essay will be hosted on Metaculus.com (a crowd forecasting platform that focuses on scientific and technological change). I am not affiliated with Metaculus, but do forecast there.

I recently came across your work PAPER in my review, and found it really useful. Given your experience with research directly involved with or adjacent to gene-editing, I am interested in hearing your thoughts on the questions:

What general attitude do you think people will have towards human gene-editing in 2030, 2050, and 2075?
and
What will be the cumulative number of genetically edited babies born by 2030, 2050, and 2075?

Any thoughts, even brief ones, would be welcome. If you do share thoughts, I think it would be helpful for forecasters if I included them in my review - I could anonymously quote you if you want - and if you specified, on a scale of 0-100, what you believe is your current level of familiarity with human gene-editing or adjacent areas.

Once I am finished with the review, I will have a set of 5-10 forecasting questions that operationalize this area of study (e.g., "On the next PEW Research Center survey on human gene-editing, what percentage of Indian respondents will find scientific research on gene-editing appropriate?). If you are interested in these types of inquiries about the future, I can share them with you, and would love to hear your thoughts on them as well.

Thank you for taking the time to read this! I really appreciate it.

Kind Regards,
Trevor Martin

In the following two sections, I provide a short introduction[^intro-thoughts] to gene-editing biology, technology, ethics, and governance.

### [Biology and Technology](#bio-tech-gene-editing)

<!-- Distill the introduction of ch.3, ch.4, and appendics of HGE-BOOK; add pictures, wiki links, and terms in glossay; expand commentary on these things where applied; link notes and quotes in footnotes  -->

Questions on gene-editing biology and technology that are probably important to consider[^questions-gene-editing]:
- What is gene-editing, and how is it performed?
- What can gene-editing currently produce?
- How has gene-editing failed?
- What can gene-editing theoretically produce?
- What bottlenecks are stalling or halting what gene-editing can produce?

The following terms are useful for understanding what gene-editing involves; to see a selection of images and visuals of these entities, please refer to the glossary.

> __Foundational Terms__[^HGE-Book]
>
> __DNA__ is a long polymer of similar repeating units of four types (A,T,C,G), where the letters denote distinct units called __nucleotide bases__. The bases pair specifically with each other (A with T and C with G) to form the well-known double helix of DNA with its two complementary strands. Segments of DNA sequence encode __genes__ that can be copied (__transcribed__) from the DNA into a second type of nucleotide polymer called __RNA__. Some of these RNAs act by pairing with other RNAs to affect their functions, while others contribute to structures neces- sary for cellular activities, including the copying of some of the RNA molecules to encode proteins. __Proteins__ are polymers of a different type of unit, called amino acids, of 20 different types; hence the copying of RNA to form proteins is known as __translation__ since the copying is into a different “language”—“written” in amino acids rather than nucleotides. These protein polymers fold into complex three- dimensional shapes that form the building blocks of the cells that make up the human body and perform the myriad functions of living organisms. The combi- nation of transcription from DNA to RNA and translation of RNA to protein is known as gene expression, and is tightly regulated so that genes are expressed at the appropriate times and places and in the correct amounts. Thus, the func- tions of individual cells are dependent on the genes they express. The complete set of genes in an organism is called its genome. Most human cells contain two complete copies of the human genome, each comprising 3 billion base pairs and encoding approximately 20,000 genes encoding proteins, plus the regulatory ele- ments that control their expression. One can think of the genome as the “code” or “software” and RNA and proteins and the structures they form as the “hardware” of cells and living organisms.


### [Ethics and Governance](#ethics-gov-gene-editing)

Questions on gene-editing ethics and governance that are probably important to consider:
- What might go wrong in all scenarios where gene-editing is used on humans?
- What might go right in all scenarios where gene-editing is used on humans?
- How should gene-editing be regulated and why?
- If gene-editing related governance is subverted, what would be the consequences?



How has discussion, research, and intellectual thinking on human gene-editing changed? One way to look at this is to see how search results for "human gene-editing" have changed over the years. The following graph displays the number of search results during the intervals of years [2000, 2021] on Google Scholar.

[^timeline]: I searched "timeline of human gene-editing" in FireFox on 05/17/2022, looked at the first page of results, and found the timeline that looked the most useful (where usefulness  = some mental function of credibility and comprehensiveness). I chose the [timeline][genetic_editing_timeline] on <https://www.synthego.com/learn/genome-engineering-history> and added links to Wikipedia pages; Synthego claims of itself: <br>"_Synthego is a genome engineering company that enables the acceleration of life science research and development in the pursuit of improved human health. <br><br> The company leverages machine learning, automation, and gene editing to build platforms for science at scale. With its foundations in engineering disciplines, the company’s platform technologies vertically integrate proprietary hardware, software, bioinformatics, chemistries, and molecular biology to advance basic research, target validation, and clinical trials. <br><br> With its technologies cited in hundreds of peer-reviewed publications and utilized by thousands of commercial and academic researchers and therapeutic drug developers, Synthego is at the forefront of innovation enabling the next generation of medicines by delivering genome editing at an unprecedented scale._"

> Although much of the current discussion around genome editing fo­cuses on how these technologies can be used to treat or prevent disease and disability, some aspects of the public debate concern other purposes, such as the possibility of [enhancing traits][wiki_enhancement] and capacities beyond levels considered typical of adequate health. In theory, genome editing for such enhancement purposes could involve both somatic and germline cells. Such uses of the technologies raise questions of fairness, social norms, personal autonomy, and the role of government.


As a consumer, if gene-editing "works as intended" in humans, my partner and I would somewhat likely (~60%) use it. Conditional on it working as intended, if some of the risks and drawbacks associated with in-vitro fertilization and egg-extraction have been reduced, then my partner and I would likely use it (~70%). If I learned more about the current and future risk landscape of gene-editing, and found that there were some major risks (for humanity or my partner) I hadn't properly understood or risks I hadn't known about, then my partner and I would be much less likely to use gene-editing.
