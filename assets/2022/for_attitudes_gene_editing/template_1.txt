> __(summary)__: request for your forecasts on people's attitudes towards human gene-editing

> Dear [Author],
>
> I am writing a short literature review (informal) on attitudes people have towards human gene-editing, for both enhancement and treatment purposes, with the goal of forecasting how people's attitudes might change in the coming years. My essay will be hosted on [Metaculus.com](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/) (a crowd forecasting platform that focuses on scientific and technological change). I am not affiliated with Metaculus, but do forecast there.

I recently came across your work [paper I read] in my review, and really [found this part helpful]/[it useful]. Given your experience with research directly involved with or adjacent to gene-editing, I am interested in hearing your thoughts on the questions:
>
__What general attitude do you think people will have towards human gene-editing in 2030, 2050, and 2075?__
>
> and
>
>
__What will be the cumulative number of genetically edited babies born by 2030, 2050, and 2075?__
>
> An example answer might be:
>
> My familiarity: 23/100; Q1: Same trend, people are much less supportive of enhancement than treatment, until ~2050. Q2: 95% confidence intervals for 2030, 2050, and 2075, respectively: 1-25000, 100-1.5m, 10k-25m

> Any thoughts, even brief ones, would be welcome. If you do share thoughts, I think it would be helpful for forecasters if I included them in my review - I could anonymously quote you if you want - and if you specified, on a scale of 0-100, what you believe is your current level of familiarity with human gene-editing or adjacent areas.
>
>  Once I am finished with the review, I will have a set of 5-10 forecasting questions that operationalize this area of study (e.g., "On the next PEW Research Center survey on human gene-editing, what percentage of Indian respondents will find scientific research on gene-editing appropriate?). If you are interested in these types of inquiries about the future, I can share them with you, and would love to hear your thoughts on them as well.
