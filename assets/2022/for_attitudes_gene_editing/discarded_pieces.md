Dear AUTHOR,

I am writing a short literature review (informal) on attitudes people have towards human gene-editing, for both enhancement and treatment purposes, with the goal of forecasting how people's attitudes might change in the coming years. My essay will be hosted on Metaculus.com (a crowd forecasting platform that focuses on scientific and technological change). I am not affiliated with Metaculus, but do forecast there.

I recently came across your work PAPER in my review, and found it really useful. Given your experience with research directly involved with or adjacent to gene-editing, I am interested in hearing your thoughts on the questions:

What general attitude do you think people will have towards human gene-editing in 2030, 2050, and 2075?
and
What will be the cumulative number of genetically edited babies born by 2030, 2050, and 2075?

Any thoughts, even brief ones, would be welcome. If you do share thoughts, I think it would be helpful for forecasters if I included them in my review - I could anonymously quote you if you want - and if you specified, on a scale of 0-100, what you believe is your current level of familiarity with human gene-editing or adjacent areas.

Once I am finished with the review, I will have a set of 5-10 forecasting questions that operationalize this area of study (e.g., "On the next PEW Research Center survey on human gene-editing, what percentage of Indian respondents will find scientific research on gene-editing appropriate?). If you are interested in these types of inquiries about the future, I can share them with you, and would love to hear your thoughts on them as well.

Thank you for taking the time to read this! I really appreciate it.

Kind Regards,
Trevor Martin

In the following two sections, I provide a short introduction[^intro-thoughts] to gene-editing biology, technology, ethics, and governance.

### [Biology and Technology](#bio-tech-gene-editing)

<!-- Distill the introduction of ch.3, ch.4, and appendics of HGE-BOOK; add pictures, wiki links, and terms in glossay; expand commentary on these things where applied; link notes and quotes in footnotes  -->

Questions on gene-editing biology and technology that are probably important to consider[^questions-gene-editing]:
- What is gene-editing, and how is it performed?
- What can gene-editing currently produce?
- How has gene-editing failed?
- What can gene-editing theoretically produce?
- What bottlenecks are stalling or halting what gene-editing can produce?

The following terms are useful for understanding what gene-editing involves; to see a selection of images and visuals of these entities, please refer to the glossary.

> __Foundational Terms__[^HGE-Book]
>
> __DNA__ is a long polymer of similar repeating units of four types (A,T,C,G), where the letters denote distinct units called __nucleotide bases__. The bases pair specifically with each other (A with T and C with G) to form the well-known double helix of DNA with its two complementary strands. Segments of DNA sequence encode __genes__ that can be copied (__transcribed__) from the DNA into a second type of nucleotide polymer called __RNA__. Some of these RNAs act by pairing with other RNAs to affect their functions, while others contribute to structures neces- sary for cellular activities, including the copying of some of the RNA molecules to encode proteins. __Proteins__ are polymers of a different type of unit, called amino acids, of 20 different types; hence the copying of RNA to form proteins is known as __translation__ since the copying is into a different “language”—“written” in amino acids rather than nucleotides. These protein polymers fold into complex three- dimensional shapes that form the building blocks of the cells that make up the human body and perform the myriad functions of living organisms. The combi- nation of transcription from DNA to RNA and translation of RNA to protein is known as gene expression, and is tightly regulated so that genes are expressed at the appropriate times and places and in the correct amounts. Thus, the func- tions of individual cells are dependent on the genes they express. The complete set of genes in an organism is called its genome. Most human cells contain two complete copies of the human genome, each comprising 3 billion base pairs and encoding approximately 20,000 genes encoding proteins, plus the regulatory ele- ments that control their expression. One can think of the genome as the “code” or “software” and RNA and proteins and the structures they form as the “hardware” of cells and living organisms.


### [Ethics and Governance](#ethics-gov-gene-editing)

Questions on gene-editing ethics and governance that are probably important to consider:
- What might go wrong in all scenarios where gene-editing is used on humans?
- What might go right in all scenarios where gene-editing is used on humans?
- How should gene-editing be regulated and why?
- If gene-editing related governance is subverted, what would be the consequences?



How has discussion, research, and intellectual thinking on human gene-editing changed? One way to look at this is to see how search results for "human gene-editing" have changed over the years. The following graph displays the number of search results during the intervals of years [2000, 2021] on Google Scholar.

[^timeline]: I searched "timeline of human gene-editing" in FireFox on 05/17/2022, looked at the first page of results, and found the timeline that looked the most useful (where usefulness  = some mental function of credibility and comprehensiveness). I chose the [timeline][genetic_editing_timeline] on <https://www.synthego.com/learn/genome-engineering-history> and added links to Wikipedia pages; Synthego claims of itself: <br>"_Synthego is a genome engineering company that enables the acceleration of life science research and development in the pursuit of improved human health. <br><br> The company leverages machine learning, automation, and gene editing to build platforms for science at scale. With its foundations in engineering disciplines, the company’s platform technologies vertically integrate proprietary hardware, software, bioinformatics, chemistries, and molecular biology to advance basic research, target validation, and clinical trials. <br><br> With its technologies cited in hundreds of peer-reviewed publications and utilized by thousands of commercial and academic researchers and therapeutic drug developers, Synthego is at the forefront of innovation enabling the next generation of medicines by delivering genome editing at an unprecedented scale._"

> Although much of the current discussion around genome editing fo­cuses on how these technologies can be used to treat or prevent disease and disability, some aspects of the public debate concern other purposes, such as the possibility of [enhancing traits][wiki_enhancement] and capacities beyond levels considered typical of adequate health. In theory, genome editing for such enhancement purposes could involve both somatic and germline cells. Such uses of the technologies raise questions of fairness, social norms, personal autonomy, and the role of government.


As a consumer, if gene-editing "works as intended" in humans, my partner and I would somewhat likely (~60%) use it. Conditional on it working as intended, if some of the risks and drawbacks associated with in-vitro fertilization and egg-extraction have been reduced, then my partner and I would likely use it (~70%). If I learned more about the current and future risk landscape of gene-editing, and found that there were some major risks (for humanity or my partner) I hadn't properly understood or risks I hadn't known about, then my partner and I would be much less likely to use gene-editing.

<!-- In my life, I discuss gene-editing with friends in the [EA][EA], [Rationality][rationality], and [Forecasting][metaculus] communities. Given my wide-ranging interests in various emerging biotechnologies, I often search for research on gene-editing, but generally am not involved enough to monitor news of progress in the field.

[EA]: https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/ "https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/"

[rationality]: https://www.lesswrong.com/ "https://www.lesswrong.com/"

There are extensive benefits for humanity that could come from altering human genomes, in terms of health and biological capability, but there are simultaneously many risks and deleterious outcomes that this technology could engender. As is the case with most emerging technologies, the possible future scenarios involving human genome editing are diverse in nature.

From my present viewpoint as someone who does not adequately understand the technical landscape of genetics research, the expected value of different plausible futures involving human gene-editing seem difficult to access, and there seems to be strong arguments for and against humanity employing gene-editing in humans.

While this essay is not one that explains, in depth, human genome editing, this brief section on its prospects and perils is aimed at adequately priming you for a discussion on what people think about human it. Of course, most people, including myself, are unfamiliar with the full scope of gene-editing technology, and instead have opinions on their individual _notion_ of what human genome editing entails.

That being said, this section tries to offer a fractional look at the questions:

- What is gene-editing, broadly speaking?
- What is the state of research on human gene-editing?
- What benefits might human gene-editing offer to humanity?
- What concerns for humanity are there with human gene-editing?

That I am not an expert in genetics is a very crucial consideration when you are reading my coverage of human gene-editing; my presentation of the content (it's depth and scope, and the order in which I present things) would likely be very different if I had more experience in the field[^sense_of_the_field].

The next section, which forms the brunt of this essay, actually gets to questions on and related to what people think about gene-editing being performed on humans. -->

> _Homo sapiens_ is a relatively young species and has not had as much time to accumulate genetic variation as have the vast majority of species on earth, most of which predate humans by enormous expanses of time. Nonetheless, there is considerable genetic variation in our species. The human genome comprises about $3 \cdot 10^9$ base pairs of DNA, and the extent of human genetic variation is such that no two humans, save identical twins, ever have been or will be genetically identical. Between any two humans, the amount of genetic variation—biochemical individuality—is about .1 percent. This means that about one base pair out of every 1,000 will be different between any two individuals. Any two (diploid) people have about $6 \cdot 10^6$ base pairs that are different, an important reason for the development of automated procedures to analyze genetic variation [See <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK20363/>]

<!-- From Wikipedia's [page on Phenylketonuria][wiki_PKU]:

>  Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of metabolism that results in decreased metabolism of the amino acid phenylalanine. Untreated PKU can lead to intellectual disability, seizures, behavioral problems, and mental disorders. It may also result in a musty smell and lighter skin. A baby born to a mother who has poorly treated PKU may have heart problems, a small head, and low birth weight. -->

<!-- [wiki_PKU]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylketonuria "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylketonuria"

A future void of PKU would probably reduce some amount of suffering, which most people would likely consider to be a GOOD thing. 

PKU is just one of example of a genetic disorders that gene-editing can help; Wikipedia's [list of genetic disorders][wiki_list_of_disorders] claims that there are more than 6000 [genetic disorders][wiki_disorder] humans suffer from.

<!-- Nonetheless, it is very easy to imagine negative events of varying magnitude involving human gene-editing. For example, imagine a scenario where a couple illegally has their child's germline modified, with the good intention of eliminating a heritable disease, and the modifications get carried through to future generations without many people knowing. Such as with mutations in DNA, it might be the case that some of the edits result in unintentional and unnoticeable side effects that are only harmful in select instances. This might not appear too bad on the face of it, but the problem is that the germline edits end up being propagated through the wider human gene pool. -->


<!-- &emsp; This essay is not an introduction to gene-editing, nor does it seek to comprehensively outline the landscape of debate for or against human gene-editing, but I hope that by adding some exposure to these things, absorbing the current state of people's attitudes towards gene-editing in the following sections will be easier or more enjoyable. -->


<!-- While I might still be misperceiving the magnitude of the expected affordances of gene-editing relative to the expected pitfalls (both indirect and direct), or vice versa, my sense is that people believe gene-editing is not risky enough to warrant a full-scale shut down of research on it, and conversely is also not potentially beneficial enough, given the expected risks, to warrant a massive (relative to the current rate of growth) influx of capital investment and research activity. -->

### [General Questions Notes](#general-questions-notes)


<!-- Looking for symptoms of people's attitudes, or the topic coming up in public conversation. Things or conferences that are renewed. Polls etc...  -->

- What will be the first country to legalized human genome editing?
- What country will have the largest use of gene-therapy?
- What will be the first country to legalize gene-editing?
- How

### [Selected Questions](#selected-questions)

<!-- - When will the first clinical trials involving human genome editing occur?
- How successful will the first clinical trials involving human genome editing be?
- When, if ever, will human gene-editing become widely available?
- When, if ever, will human gene-editing become widely performed?
- In what ways might gene-editing be regulated, if available and/or widely used?
- What are the failure modes for human gene-editing, and how should their severity and likelihood be evaluated? -->

I will come back to this point, but for now, I imagine that generating considerations and scenarios for what transformative effects gene-editing humans could have on humanity is still important; part of this might involve answering or attempting to answer the following questions on human gene-editing (these apply to both treatment and enhancement):



### [Subjective Summary and Other Considerations](#summary-considerations)


__Summary__ 

"A speculative piece that is trying to be a report"

Here is a breakdown of what I feel this essay is:

- What I think is important
- Attempt at being transparent 
- What I did 
- Some prior beliefs, not refined
- Acknowledgements 
- Motivation 
  - Humans want to be happy and fulfilled 
  - 
  - Genetic disorders 
- Prospects and Perils
  - I am interested in biotech. but not obsessed 
  - Gene-editing might be good; society is complex
  - Again, gene-editing good/bad? idk
  - Might as well do a quick scan of gene-editing
  - Some questions concerning gene-editing 
  - Don't take what I say as the whole story
  - Note on the next section 
  - Important terms 
  - The terms are similar 
  -  
  
__Other Considerations__ 

- In what ways are gene-editing, genome editing, genetic engineering, gene therapy, and genetic modification different?

<!-- Hello, I am a recently graduated student of Neuroscience and Mathematics from [college], and I am writing a forecasting review of people's attitudes towards human gene-editing. Part of this review is creating forecasting questions. For example, on a PEW Research Center report from 2020, 56% of Indian respondents found gene-editing an appropriate use of science, so we may ask, what % of Indian respondents will find gene-editing an appropriate use of science in 2025? My problem here is that the PEW Research Center and other organizations involved with surveying people's takes on gene-editing are not guaranteed to consistently conduct these surveys. My "ask" to NHGRI is an answer to whether the NHGRI will conduct a survey on people's attitudes towards human gene-editing in the next 10 years, and whether I can talk to a genetics-researcher about this topic (I am interested in aggregating expert opinions on these forecasting questions). Thank you for reading all of this, and I wish you the best!

Kind regards,
name -->


<!-- Gene-editing does not come up in many conversations I have, and when I do mention it, my fairly neurotypical Western friends and family react mostly with cached concern-oriented thoughts such as "If everyone was intelligent, there would be no garbage men (my grandma)" and "Isn't that eugenics?" -->

<!-- _What do people think about tampering with human genes?_
_What factors are tied to people's attitudes on gene-editing?_
_What does the future landscape of opinions look like for human gene-editing?_ -->

[^intro-thoughts]: The extent of this introduction was guided how much I felt I needed to understand gene-editing to write this essay, and by my desire to limit the content on gene-editing relative to people's attitudes on it - bringing back up the thought "this is an essay on attitudes towards gene-editing, not gene-editing" helped with this.

[^sense_of_the_field]: This statement is supported for me by my anecdotal experience that, after reading another research paper or book chapter on human genome editing, the distinctions I make and the scope of what I believe should be discussed in a purview of human genome editing, among others things, alter largely from what I had written before being exposed to the additional content.

  - _What are your biases?_[^biases]
  - _How have you atoned for these biases?_[^atonment]

  [^biases]: _What are my biases?_: I am a human - [cognitive biases][wiki_biases] apply accordingly; With regard to human gene-editing, my current belief is that it's expected value is positive, in the long-term. I am optimistic about the average future involving human gene-editing for both treatment and enhancement purposes. 

[^atonment]: _How have you atoned for these biases?_: In this essay, I do not discuss what humanity "should do" with gene-editing, and I have attempted to control for my optimism in my forecasts on people's attitudes towards human gene-editing.

[^forecast]: This is a tentative estimate, and is more in line with how much I think people's opinions will differ from might. I would consider a small difference in forecasts to be around 10%, and a large one to be around 35%. What constitutes a "small" and "large" difference in forecasts probably differs somewhat between people. I would appreciate if you share your forecasts for the questions in this essay in the comments and outline your reasoning. I would also appreciate critiques of my forecasts, as I am typically underconfident.
