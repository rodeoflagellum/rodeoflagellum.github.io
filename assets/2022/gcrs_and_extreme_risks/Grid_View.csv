230,General,General,Invest in resilience,"A resilience framing accepts that extreme events will occur and prioritizes strategies to limit the loss and prevent spiraling knock-on effects. Resilience planning should occur at multiple levels and take several forms. Strategies to provide essential food, water and power in the event of severe disruption lasting weeks or months should be a standard consideration of city authorities. Distributed systems that provide power, water and food are less susceptible to cataclysmic point failure than completely centralized systems (Perrow 1999). Within growing populations especially in informal settlements in low-income country cities and with progressive per capita availability of freshwater, decentralized approaches that leverage local resources to provide safe drinking water and reduce environmental contamination are being deployed at several sites. Urban gardens and urban farms can improve the resilience of neighborhoods and cities. Such distributed systems are increasingly efficient and are being adopted in many contexts",National,Risk and Response to Biological Catastrophe in Lower Income Countries,"Luby S., Arthur R.",https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/82_2019_162,2019

We recommend broadening the provision to add new high-risk systems and risk areas.

• The emergence of increasingly general-purpose systems, which are then adapted and deployed for specific domains by secondary developers or users.

Even where provisions for adaptability exist in principle, historical experience suggests that updating regulations frequently or quickly enough can be challenging. Specifically, we suggest that:
