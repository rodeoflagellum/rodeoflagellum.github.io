## [Discriminating Characteristics](#discriminating-characteristics)
_Some identifying information_

I expect most people will find the following discriminatory characteristics useful for gauging how much I should be trusted, and for getting a picture of what intersection of human clades I fall into. Most of these identifying categories come from my memory of demographics surveys I've answered; most of these categories are also things that I would be somewhat interested in learning about of someone who writes online semi-anonymously. 

I used Python's ```random.shuffle()``` 1 time on the bullet points below (the points were originally ordered differently; I'm unsure as to why I don't want people knowing the original order that these bullets came to my mind). Also, note that ~Y (x%) roughly means "I am x% confident that approximately Y applies to me" and that ~x% means "I believe I am x%".

- __Suspected Weight__: ~160 lbs (~72.6 kg) (80%)
- __Tribes__: Effective Altruism movement,  Rationality movement
- __Race__: Caucasoid
- __Gender Identity__: ~heterosexual (60%)
- __Disabilities or Cognitive Abnormalities__: None diagnosed
- __Favorite Nourishment__: dark chocolate, almonds, coffee, blackberries
- __Suspected IQ__: ~120 (70%)
- __Education__: B.A. Neuroscience and B.A. Mathematics
- __Suspected Cognitive Abnormalities__: low empathy (75%), mild autism (60%), some attention deficit (60%)
- __Age__: Below 40 years
- __Predominant Life Location__: United States 

This list could include many more entries, but I am content to leave it at its current length for the time being. Ideally, 'rodeo flagellum' or 'cirrostratus whispers' are not directly identified with _my person_. I am a proponent for online anonymity and privacy, but I don't allocate much effort to this beyond using FireFox with privacy extensions and using Tor occasionally. I have not thought much about what metadata I generate by participating online in the way I do, and about whether I should take steps to limit what data I generate.

## [Interests](#interests)
_Those things that I believe I am interested in, at the moment_

While many of my interests can be gleaned from the tags I've listed earlier, there are also less well defined topics that I want to include here. These topics are things I want to learn more about and believe might be promising areas to work on or learn more about; I do not yet have a _raison d'Ãªtre_, but would like to find one. There's still great uncertainty on my end concerning which fields or problems I should allocate most of my time to, but deep learning for forecasting or data analysis for longevity research seem like good candidates, at least at the intersection of my interest in them and my ability to contribute to them.

In the list below, each topic of interest is preceded by some statement of preference that illuminates why I am interested in that topic. These justifications for my interests are not fleshed out, and there is are some interests that have multiple justifications. Consider the list below a first pass and an incomplete selection of what things I am interested in and of why I am interested in those things. 

- I don't like when people suffer or die &rarr; _longevity research, measurement and enhancment of well-being, global health and development_
- I would like to know what might occur in my life, and how aspects of human civilization, progress, etc... might change &rarr; _judgemental forecasting, quantitative/statistical modeling, research progress and growth_
- I want to live long and be healthy &rarr; _nutrition, health, psychology, sleep, exercise_
- I want to make good decisions and be less wrong &rarr; _rationality, decision theory, bayesian inference, game theory_
- I want humanity to continue existing, to realize new modes of being, and to have a great future &rarr; _global catastrophic risk reduction, global priorities research, civilizational stability, human enhancement, longtermism, transhumanism_
- I want to hasten scientific and technological progress &rarr; _AI safety/alignment, AI/DL, meta-science_
- I want to better understand how minds, life, and biology works &rarr; _neuroscience, origins of life research, biotechnology_
- I want my children to intelligent, kind, and well-off generally &rarr; _embryo selection, polygenic screening, genetic-engineering, parenting_

## [Personality and Morals](#personality-morals)
_My results of some psychological surveys_

Following Gwern's example, I've taken a slew of personality and morals surveys on the website [YourMorals.org](https://yourmorals.org/), whose contributors perform social psychology research. I have an entire post on this called My Personality and Morals, but here are some of the results I believe might be somewhat interesting or useful to others.

## [Goals](#goals)
_A tentative list of some things I want to do_ 

My goals change semi-frequently, as I learn and produce more, but here is the current list. Following each entry, there is some rating (x / y / z), where _x_ corresponds to how confident I am that I want this thing, _y_ corresponds to how much effort I think I am willing to devote to getting this, and _z_ corresponds to how likely I think it is that I will no longer want this thing in the near-term (maybe 5 years from now) future. There is great variety in the nature and scope of the goals included below.
