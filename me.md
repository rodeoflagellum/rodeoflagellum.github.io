## [Discriminating Characteristics](#discriminating-characteristics)

I expect most people will find the following discriminatory characteristics useful for gauging how much I should be trusted, and for getting a picture of what human clade I fall into. Most of these identifying categories come from my memory of demographics surveys I've answered. 

I used Python's ```random.shuffle()``` 1 time on the bullet points below (the points were originally ordered differently; I'm unsure as to why I don't want people knowing the original order that these bullets came to my mind). Also, note that ~Y (x%) means "I am x% confident that approximately Y applies to me" and that ~x% means "I believe I am x%".

- __Suspected Weight__: ~160 lbs (~72.6 kg) (80%)
- __Tribes__: Effective Altruism movement,  Rationality movement
- __Race__: Caucasoid
- __Gender Identity__: ~heterosexual (60%)
- __Disabilities or Cognitive Abnormalities__: None diagnosed
- __Favorite Nourishment__: dark chocolate, almonds, coffee, blackberries
- __Suspected IQ__: ~120 (70%)
- __Education__: B.A. Neuroscience and B.A. Mathematics
- __Suspected Cognitive Abnormalities__: low empathy (75%), mild autism (60%), some attention deficit (60%)
- __Age__: Below 40 years
- __Predominant Life Location__: United States 

This list could include many more entries, but I am content to leave it at its current length for the time being. Ideally, 'rodeo flagellum' or 'cirrostratus whispers' are not directly identified with _my person_. I am a proponent for online anonymity and privacy, but I don't allocate much effort to this beyond using FireFox with privacy extensions and using Tor occasionally. I have not thought much about what metadata I generate by participating online in the way I do, and about whether I should take steps to limit what data I generate.  

## [Interests](#interests)

While many of my interests can be gleaned from the tags I've listed earlier, there are also less well defined topics that I want to include here. These topics are things I want to learn more about and believe might be promising areas to work on; I do not yet have a _raison d'Ãªtre_, but would like to find one. There's still great uncertainty on my end, but deep learning for forecasting or data analysis for longevity research might be the fields of study I begin, overwhelmingly, to allocate my time to. Justifications for my interests precede the areas of research and progress I find interesting. There is a lot of overlap between the justifications and interest areas not included under them, and between interest areas - this list just serves as a rough blueprint for where my attention goes.

- I don't like when people suffer or die &rarr; _longevity research, measurement of well-being, global health and development_
- I want to know what might happen in my own life, and with humanity &rarr; _judgemental forecasting, quantitative modeling, machine/deep learning_
- I want to live long and be healthy &rarr; _nutrition, health, psychology_
- I want to make good decisions and be less wrong &rarr; _rationality, decision theory, bayesian inference_
- I want humanity to continue existing and to realize new modes of being &rarr; _global catastrophic risk reduction, global priorities research, civilizational stability, human enhancement_
- I want to hasten progress &rarr; _progress studies, superintelligence, meta-science_
- I want to understand how minds and life works &rarr; _neuroscience, origins of life research, biotechnology_
- I want my children to intelligent, kind, and well-off generally &rarr; _embryo selection, polygenic screening, genetic-engineering_

Pooled interests: [_longevity research_, _well-being measurement_, _judgemental forecasting_, _quantitative modeling_, _deep learning_, 

## [Personality and Morals](#personality-morals)

Following Gwern's example, I've taken a slew of personality and morals surveys on the website [YourMorals.org](https://yourmorals.org/), whose contributors perform social psychology research. I have an entire post on this called My Personality and Morals.
