_Purpose_: My intention with this page is to give you resources to determine how much you should trust my writing and viewpoints.

I believe that what I left out from this list were things that I didn't find immediately meaningful. I am also aiming not to have my actual person identified, so I've purposely left this list short (there was never an exact threshold). I currently have little sense of what the metadata of what I've chosen to include in this list tells about me, and would be interested to hear anyone's thoughts on this. I used the shuffling to remove the metadata of what order I originally wrote the entries. Some people already know _me_, but this page exists for those of you who don't.
